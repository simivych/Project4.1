Sowing always begins from a player's own holes. When the last counter falls into an empty hole, the turn ends. If the last counter falls into an occupied hole, the contents of that hole are picked up and sowing continues. A hole is captured by dropping the last counter of a sowing into an opponent's hole which contains three counters, making it have four counters, and becomes a wegue. Captures cannot be made until after the original three counters placed in the holes at the beginning of the game have been moved. Once a wegue is created, the player cannot sow from it. When the final counter of a sowing lands in a wegue owned by the opponent, the player captures two counters from it. Play continues until all of the counters are captured or all of the counters are accumulated in wegue. A new round begins. Players then collect the counters in their captured holes.

28,35,7,Seleucid,,Proposed by Irving Finkel based on rules from Mesopotamia. ,6,This ruleset comes from the interpretation by Irving Finkel of cuneiform tablets from the Seleucid Period which appear to describe 20 Squares. ,"Boards consist of a grid of 3x4 squares and a continuation of the central row in the grid that extends for 8 further squares. The game is played with two astragals as dice: one from a sheep and one from an ox. The sheep astragal provides the base value for the roll, and the ox astragal serves as a bonus. Rolls of the sheep astragal produce values of 1, 2 ,3 or 4. The ox astragal produces a ""yes"" or ""no"" value. If ""no"" is rolled, the values remain the same. If ""yes"" is rolled, the value of the first roll is boosted to 5, 6, 7, or 10, respectively. These rules are proposed by Finkel based on the values of moves provided in the cuneiform tablets (Finkel 2007: 21–22). Each player starts play on one of the right corners of the 3x4 grid, proceeding left down that row to the opposite corner, and then right down the central track, which both players use, with the goal of moving off the end of the track. If a player lands on a square occupied by the opponent, the opponent's piece is removed from the board and may reenter on a subsequent turn. Rosettes on certain squares in the central track mark spaces where a player is safe from being sent to the beginning. Rosettes in the corners allow a player to roll again when a player lands on them. A player wins when they remove all seven of their pieces from the board by rolling the exact number of spaces left in the track, plus one.",Finkel 2007.,,,,,"31°19'26.84""N, 45°38'15.93""E","2874,3324",0,,0,0

120,135,113,Qelat II,,Observed by R. Pankhurst.,3,These rules were observed by R. Pankhurst in the mid-twentieth century. ,"2x6 board. Play begins with four counters in each hole. A player picks up the contents of any of their holes and sowing them in an anti-clockwise direction, picking up the contents of the last hole in which his counters fall, and continuing sowing. This continues until the last counter falls in an empty hole. Then it is the other player's turn. A hole is captured when the last ball is dropped into an opponent's hole containing three counters, making it four. A player cannot then take from one of these holes that they have captured. Therefore, the player cannot begin a turn from their own captured hole nor can they continue sowing from it if their last counter falls into it. If the last counter of a sowing falls into an opponent's captured hole, one of those counters are removed from the board and placed in the store, and the sowing continues with the contents of any of the player's holes. Ownership of a hole continues even if it becomes empty. When a player cannot move (i.e., there are no counters in their holes except any that are in captured holes), the opponent continues to move until the player is able to move. Play continues until all counters are either placed in the store or in captured holes and thus cannot be moved. Players then count their pieces by placing four in each hole, and the player who has more than their original number takes ownership of one of the opponent's holes for every four counters more than the original number that have been taken. If no player took four more than the original, the player with three extra gets the hole, if each player has two extra they draw lots to see who gets an extra hole. Play then begins again as before. The game ends when one player owns all of the counters, and thus all of the holes.",Pankhurst 1971: 167-168.,,,,,"15°46'45.68""N, 38°26'55.28""E","5471,5471",0,,0,0

There are six points on either side, with each side divided in half by two short parallel lines, the rivers. There are four arcs in the corners of the ""square"". The points and lines are the playing spaces. Players play on two teams. One stick, serving as the playing piece, per team, which start one each on the parallel lines on the bottom side. Each team has four scoring sticks. There are also four throwing sticks, blank on one side and marked on the other. The number of marked sides is the value of the throw, except when all are face up, which scores 5, and when only blank sides are up, which scores 10. Throws of 5 or 10 give the player another throw. All of the players on a team throw before the players of the other team throw. Each team moves in an opposite direction around the board. If a team's stick lands in the river across from the starting space, the team forfeits one of their scoring sticks to the other team, and begins again from start. If a player lands on the same space as the opposing team's stick, the opposing team's stick is sent back to start, and the playing team wins a scoring stick from the opposing team. When a team reaches the river after the starting point, having completed a circuit of the board, the team wins a scoring stick from the opposing team.

The fifth hole from the left in the inner row is rectangular, the rest are circular. 64 counters. Play begins with one counter in each hole in the inner row. Players take turns placing their remaining counters on the board in their inner rows. When they place a counter, they capture the hole facing it in the opponent's inner row, and sows the counters from either the leftmost or the rightmost hole of the player's inner row, sowing along the inner row. However, if the capture occurs from the rightmost, leftmost, or the next hole adjacent to each in the inner row, the captured pieces must be placed in the leftmost or rightmost hole, whichever is closer. The player may choose which hole to place captured counters in when captures are made from the central four holes in the inner row. The player must capture if possible, if not possible they place a counter into any of the holes in their inner row, pick up the contents of that hole, and sow in either direction. While sowing, if the final counter falls into an occupied hole and the opponent's hole opposite it has counters, the counters in the opponent's hole are captured. If the final counter falls into an occupied hole and the hole opposite it is empty, the counters are picked up and sowing continues in the same direction. If the final counter falls into an empty hole, the turn ends. If during this phase, the opponent's inner row is cleared of counters, the player wins. If all of the counters have been introduced and both players still have counters in their inner row, play proceeds to a second phase. Second Phase: Counters are picked up from any hole on the player's side and sown in either direction. The same capture, sowing, and victory rules apply as before.

134,149,127,Nard,,Rules of Nard.,1,These rules were described to K. Himly by a Persian friend living in Berlin in the late nineteenth century.,"The game is played on a board with twelve points on either side. The points form a continuous track in a horseshoe shape; each player progresses in opposite directions (one from their bottom right to the top right, the other from their bottom left to their top left). Each player has 15 pieces. The starting position is as such, numbering the points from the origin of each player's track: Point six: five pieces. Point 8: three pieces. Point 13: five pieces. Point 24: two pieces. Players move according to the number on each die by moving one piece the number on one die and another the number on the other die, or by moving one piece twice (once for each die). Players cannot end their move on a point with multiple opposing pieces. If a player ends the turn on a point with one opposing piece, that piece is placed in the middle of the board (not on a point) and must reenter the board according to the next die roll, counting the origin point as a move of one. They cannot reenter on a point with two or more pieces. No other pieces can move until all of the pieces belonging to that player are removed from the center. When all of a player's pieces are on their final 6 points, they may start removing pieces from the board. They can do so by rolling a 6 to move from the 6th point, and so on down to 1. Players must use all available moves presented by the dice. The first player to remove all of their pieces wins. The winner gains one point, or two points if the opponent has pieces in their starting quadrant.

Each player has three types of pieces: Circles, triangle, squares, and one pyramid made up of multiple pieces stacked. Circles move one space orthogonally. Triangles move two spaces diagonally. Squares move three spaces orthogonally. Pyramids may move in any of the directions allowed by one of its constituent pieces. Each piece has a number. For white—circles: 2, 4, 6, 8, 4, 16, 36, 64; triangles: 6, 20 , 42, 72, 9, 25, 49, 81; squares: 15, 45, 153, 25, 81, 169, 289; pyramid (91) from the base: square 36, square 25, triangle 16, triangle 9, circle 4, circle 1. For black—circles: 3, 5, 7, 9, 9, 25, 49, 81; triangles: 12, 30, 56, 90, 16, 36, 64, 100; squares: 28, 66, 120, 49, 121, 225, 361; pyramid (190): from the base: square 64, square 49, triangle 36, triangle 25, circle 16. 

Pieces capture other pieces by mathematical allowances based on the numbers on the pieces. There are nine scenarios in which pieces can be taken when a piece moves to a space occupied by an opponent's piece. 

Multiplication with distance: If the value of the piece to be taken equals the value of the piece making the capture multiplied by the distance between the two pieces; 

Division by distance: If the value of the piece to be taken equals the value of the piece making the capture divided by the distance between the pieces. 

Addition: When two pieces can both move to the space of an opponent's piece, if the sum of the two pieces equals the value of the opponent's piece, it is captured and the player chooses which piece to move to that space. 

Subtraction: When two pieces can both move to the space of an opponent's piece, if the difference between the value of these pieces equals the value of the opponent's piece, it is taken, and the player chooses which piece to move to the space. 

Multiplication: When two pieces can both move to the space of an opponent's piece, if the product of the values of the two pieces equals the value of the opponent's piece, it is taken and the player chooses which piece to move to the space. 

Division: When two pieces can both move to the space of an opponent's piece, if the quotient of the values of the two pieces equals the value of the opponent's piece, it is taken and the player chooses which piece to move to the space.

Encirclement: If pieces are positioned such that there is no possible move or capture for the opponent's piece, the opponent's piece is taken.

Pyramid capture: A pyramid can be captured by capturing its constituent pieces one-by-one according to the above methods; by encircling it so it cannot move, or by obtaining the sum of the constituent pieces or of its base pieces according to the above rules; A pyramid captures as a single one of its component pieces according to the above rules (the direction of the move is independent of the value chosen), or by using the sum of its pieces according to the above rules.

The goal of the game is to capture the opponent's pyramid and to create an alignment on the opponent's half of the board forming a mathematical progression. The progression may be arithmetic (a sequence where the difference between the values is constant), geometric (where each value after the first is determined by multiplying the previous value by a fixed number), or harmonic (1/a, 1/a+d, 1/a+2d, 1/a+3d).

The four corners, the four central squares, and two center squares on each side are crosscut, like shown. Two, three, or four people can play the game. If two players are playing, each would sit on one side of the board and enter their two pieces onto the center crosscut squares along the outer side The object of the game is to be the first player to enter and exit both his pieces.

There are two semi circles of five holes on the outside of two opposite corners of the board. Two pieces per player. Four stick dice are used, each with one marked side. Each die is marked differently for a different value: 4, 6, 14, 15. The throws are as follows: All marked sides up = 5; three marked sides up = 3; two marked sides up = 2, one marked side up = the value of the marked side; zero marked sides up = 10. Throws of 14 may instead be played as a throw of 1, whenever the player chooses. Players’ pieces enter on the branching arcs. Players move in opposite directions around the board, and then back down the arc in which they started, moving their pieces off the board. If a player lands on the same spot as the opponent, the opponent’s piece is removed from the board and must re-enter. A player's piece is allowed to occupy the same space as that player's other piece. On the last side of the rectangle before completing a circuit of the board, only throws of 1, 2, or 3 are used. Players must make an exact throw to get a piece off the board. The first player to remove their pieces from the board wins.

160,175,154,Default,,Standard rules for Fevga.,1,These are the standard rules for the Greek Backgammon variant Fevga.,"Played on a standard Backgammon board. Each player has fifteen pieces, which all begin on the leftmost point on each player's side of the board. Both players move anti-clockwise around the board. Both players roll one die, and the player with the higher number plays first. If it is played after another game, the winner of the previous game goes first. The player rolls two die and begins play with that roll. Players move according to the number on each die by moving one piece the value on one die then another piece the value on the other die, or by moving one piece the value of one die and then the value of the other. When doubles are thrown, they are played twice. If a player can only play one number but not both, they must play the higher number, if possible. To begin, each player may only move one piece, until it passes the opponent's starting point, after which any pieces can be moved. Pieces may only be moved to an empty point or one occupied by another piece belonging to the player. Players may not block all six points in either player's starting quadrant. If a player has blocked six points in a row, and the opponent has moved all of their pieces to the point adjacent to the blocked points, the player must move to unblock one of the points. Once a player has moved all of their pieces into the final six points of their track, they may begin bearing off. They do so by rolling a number equal to the number of points left in the track, plus one. If they cannot bear off, they must make a legal move with a piece that cannot bear off. If no such move is available, then they must bear off the piece which is furthest from the goal. The first player to bear off all their pieces wins the game and gets one point. If the winner bears off all their pieces before the opponent bears off any, they get two points.

161,176,155,Default,,Standard rules for Plakoto.,1,These are the rules of the Greek backgammon variant Plakoto.,"Played on a standard Backgammon board. Each player starts with fifteen pieces on the starting point of their track. Two six-sided dice. The pieces move around the board in opposite directions in a horseshoe-shaped track.

Each player rolls one die. The player who rolls highest goes first. The player then rolls two die to begin play.  The numbers on the two dice constitute separate moves; i.e. a piece must move the full value of an individual die. One piece may move the combined total of the two die. Doubles are played twice. A player must use both numbers of a roll if possible, or all four numbers in the case of doubles. 

If a player lands on a point occupied by a single opposing piece, the opponent’s piece is trapped until the trapping player removes their piece.

A piece may not be moved to a point occupied by two or more of the opponent's pieces. The player cannot move a piece to a point where the opponent has trapped another of the player's pieces. 


Once a player has moved all fifteen of their pieces into the their home section of the board (that is, the six points at the end of the player's track), the player may begin bearing off. A player cannot bear off when the player has one or more pieces trapped inside the their home section. A player bears off by rolling a number equal to the number of points left in the track of a piece, plus one. If there is no piece on the point indicated by the roll, then the player must make a legal move using a piece that will not remove it from the board. If there are no pieces available to fulfill this condition, the player must remove a piece that is furthest from the goal. The first player to bear off all fifteen pieces wins the game.

If the last piece belonging to player remains in the starting position is trapped by the opponent before it has left the starting position, the player loses. The only exception is if the opponent still has pieces on their starting position. A game in which both players' respective pieces in the starting position are trapped is a draw.

In Tavli, in subsequent rounds, the winner of the previous round plays first.

The game is also typically played with a point system, where points are lost based on the winning conditions. Players lose two points by losing if they haven't yet borne off any of their pieces, or one point if they have borne off at least one piece. A player who loses because their final piece in the starting position was trapped loses two points.","<a href=""https://bkgm.com/articles/Mamoun/PlakotoBoardGameStrategy.pdf"" target=""_blank"" class=""style1"" style=""color: #0000EE"" />bkgm.com</a>",,,,,,"0,5520",0,,0,0
162,177,156,Tawula,,Rules for Tawuls.,1,These rules were played in Asia Minor in the mid-nineteenth century.,"The game is played on a board with twelve points on either side. The points form a continuous track in a horseshoe shape; both players progress in an anti-clockwise direction. Fifteen pieces per player, two six-sided dice. Each player begins with two pieces on the rightmost point on the opposite side of the board. Players move according to the number on each die by moving one piece the number on one die and other the number on the other die, or by moving one piece the total number of both die. Further pieces are entered based on the roll of the dice, the point after the one with the two pieces on it at the beginning being counted as the first point. When entering captured pieces, however, the point where the two pieces start is counted as the first point. The two pieces which start on the board cannot be moved until all of the remaining pieces have been entered on the board. No more than one piece may rest on a point on the first half of the board, except for the two which start and also on the leftmost point on the opposite side of the board from where the player sits. When a piece lands on a point occupied by an opponent's piece, the opponent's piece is removed from the board and must be entered again. Players must enter captured pieces before continuing to move the other pieces on the board. When a piece is captured in the opponent's starting quadrant, a point must be left open or with only one piece, thus allowing the opponent to enter their piece. The player to move all of their pieces off the board wins.

The throws are as follows: One flat side up = 1; two flat sides up = 2; three flat sides up = 4, zero flat sides up = 6. The pieces begin on the outer end of the track, and must throw a 1 to begin play. Once a player has left the starting spot, they move according to the throws, except on throws of 1, which are tabulated for use later. Players continue to throw until they throw 2. Players must land on the last space of the track, I.e. at the center of the spiral, by an exact throw. The player must then roll 1 five times before leaving this space and proceeding back to the starting point. Accumulated rolls of 1 may be used for this. The first player to reach the starting space by an exact throw releases the hyena. The hyena proceeds along the track in the same manner, but moving twice the value of each throw. When the hyena reaches the end of the track, it must throw or pay 1 ten times.

165,180,159,Shing Quon Tu,,Rules given by Hyde.,1,Rules reported by Hyde for Shing Kun T'o.,"98 spaces on the board. Six six-sided dice. One piece per player. Pieces are initially placed on the board based on the values of the throws of the dice. The throws are as follows:

Space one: two 1s;
Space 2: two 2s;
Space 3: two 3s;
Space 4: two  4s
Space 5: two 5s;
Space 6: two 6s;

Space 18; four 3s;
Space 19; four 4s;
Space 20: four 5s;
Space 21: four 6s.

From here, the players move to prescribed spaces based on the throw they make, based on the instructions for the space they are currently on. There are three throws which result in a move: Te (""Influence""; double 4s), Cung (""Pair""; double 2, 3, 5, or 6) or Chang (""Failure""; double 1). The players use the throws as many times as allowed (e.g., six 5s = three Cung, allowing the player to move Cung from each successive square). Throws which do not produce a result where the player can move result in a pass.

Throws of Te generally advance the player along the board. A throw of Te moves the player to the next consecutively numbered space, with the following exceptions:  1-3 to 37; 4-6 to 38; 7 to 73; 8 to 72; 9 to 52; 10 to 51; 11 to 50; 12 to 49; 13 to 48; 14 to 47; 15 to 55; 16-21 to 23; 27 to 56; 30 to 32; 35 to 67; 36 to 66; 46 to 89; 47 to 59; 48 to 74; 49 to 71; 50 to 47; 51 to 50; 52 to 51; 59 to 71; 60 to 62; 61 to 47; 62 to 61; 63 to 65; 64 to 69; 65 to 64; 66 to 60; 67 to 70; 68 to 86; 69 to 84; 70 to 68; 71 to 74; 72 to 90; 73 to 92; 75 to 93; 81 to 31; 82 to 91; 83-88 to the previous consecutively numbered square; 89 to 91; 90 to 92; 91 to 93; 92 to 94; 94 to 97; 95 to 98; 96 to 95.

Throws of Cung move players from: 1, 2, and 3 to 76; 8 to 60; 9 to 23; 15 to 53; 16-21 to 22; 27 to 25; 37 to 36; 41 to 30; 42 to 31; 47 to 54; 48 to 65; 49 to 54; 69 to 88. 

Throws of Chang move the player to space 28 from spaces 54-59, or to space 29 from spaces 30-35 and 68. Players must throw Te to leave spaces 28 or 29, and return to the space they previously occupied.

Players begin by placing their pieces two-by-two in places as they see fit, except for the central space. Once all the spaces except the central one are filled, the player who placed their pieces last moves a piece one space orthogonally to the empty space. Pieces are captured by surrounding them on either side by a player's own pieces. Multiple captures are allowed, and multiple pieces can be captured in a single move. A player may move their piece between two of the opponent's pieces without it resulting in a capture. Pieces in the central spot cannot be captured. If a player cannot move, the opponent must move so that the player can move on their next turn. The player to capture all of the opponent's pieces wins.

The points form a continuous track in a horseshoe shape; each player progresses in opposite directions (one from their bottom right to the top right, the other from their bottom left to their top left). Each player has fifteen pieces, which all begin on the first point of their track. Two dice are used. Players move according to the number on each die by moving one piece the value on one die then another piece the value on the other die, or by moving one piece the value of one die and then the value of the other. The maximum number of pieces per point is two, except for the starting point. Placing pieces on the twelfth point of a player's side is only allowed when it can be achieved by two pieces on the same dice roll. A player's pieces only actually move on the player's half of the board; points are awarded for any hypothetical move that would move a player's pieces along the imagined track onto the opponent's side of the board that would land on a point with a lone opposing piece (a ""hit""). The player then moves pieces on their side of the board that are able to move. If the hypothetical hit is in the opponents' nearest half of the board according to the track, the player scores two points, four points if it was achieved by rolling doubles. If the hit is in the further half of the opponent's side of the board, the player scores four or six if made by doubles. Players play until one scores twelve points.

Two to four players, each player with two pieces. Played with two four-sided dice, marked 1, 3, 4, 6. Throws may be divided as the players see fit between their pieces. Doubles allow another throw. Players start with their pieces on the marked square on their side of the board. Pieces move along a spiraling track, starting in an anti-clockwise direction around the outer edges of the board, then changing to a clockwise direction when reaching the 32nd space in the track, and continuing in this direction in a spiral pattern until reaching the central square. If a player lands on a space occupied by an opponent's piece, the opponent's piece is removed from the board, and the player must throw a double 1 to enter it again on their starting square. Pieces resting on a marked space are safe from being sent to the start. The goal is to reach the central square with both pieces, which must be reached by an exact throw. If a piece is 1, 3, or 4 spaces from the center, the player must throw doubles of that number to reach the goal.

The pieces move along the outer track of the board according to the throw of three four-sided dice with values of 1, 2, 5 and 6. The values of each die must be played individually, except in certain cases. Each player has four pieces, which begin on the sixth and seventh space of the central row and the seventh and eight space in the right hand row of the arm of the board belonging to the player.

The store to the right of the player belongs to the player. Play begins with five counters in each regular hole, with one larger stone in each store, but one is slightly smaller than the other. Game can be played with two or four players. With four players, two players control the larger stones, but cannot move the regular counters. Players throw out a finger (index, little, or thumb) to determine who plays first. Index beats thumb, thumb beats little finger, little finger beats index. This happens at the start of each round. Counters are taken from any of the holes in the player's row, sowing them in either direction, including the stores. When the last counter of a sowing is dropped in a hole, sowing continues by picking up the counters in the next hole and continuing to sow in that direction. If the hole following the last seed of a sowing is empty, the counters in the hole following this empty hole are captured. If there is an empty hole following the captured hole, and then an occupied hole immediately after it, the counters in the occupied hole are also captured, and so forth until there are two occupied or two empty holes in a row. Moves may not begin from stores. Both stores are sown into normally by both players. Stores are considered to be empty, except when its large stone remains in it, then the large stone only can be sown or captured and not any other counters that may have accumulated there. Large stones can be sown in any order a player chooses during a sowing. If a player has no counters in their holes, they may opt to place one counter in each of their holes, taking counters from their store and continue play (called huelshe). If they opt not to, the opponent takes all the remaining stones on the board. If one of the large stones remains in its original store, the player cannot opt out. If the player doesn't have enough stones for all of the holes, they may choose which holes in their row to place the counters, but they must form a continuous sequence of holes with counters. When the round ends, players must buy back their large stones if they no longer have them, at a price determined in the beginning of the game (usually seven for the larger stone and six for the smaller). Players then attempt to refill their holes with the original number of counters. The player that has fewer than the original number of counters must borrow counters from the opponent. Debt accumulates over subsequent rounds. When the debt reaches five, the player must sell one of their holes to the opponent. The selling player can choose which holes to sell. The seller then receives five counters to either repay debt or fill holes as long as debt does not exceed four. ",Eagle 1995: 53.,China,,,,"26°57'15.13""N, 100°13'3.04""E","5492,5493",0,,0,0

Sowing occurs in either a clockwise or anti-clockwise direction; the first player chooses the direction and all subsequent moves are made in that direction. Players sow beginning from holes in their row. In the course of sowing, a player cannot sow into a hole containing three counters; if one is encountered, it is skipped and the counter is sowed into the next hole without three. If the final counter falls into a hole containing three counters, the contents of the hole are captured and the contents of the next hole are picked up and sowing continues. Otherwise, if the last counter falls into a hole with counters, these are picked up and sowing continues, or if it falls into an empty hole the turn ends. Throughout the game, single counters cannot be moved if a player has a hole with multiple counters, and a single counter in the front hole cannot be moved if there are other single counters in the player's row. The round ends when one player's holes are empty. The player with counters remaining in their holes captures these counters.

A second round begins with the winner of the first round placing four counters in each of their holes, leaving any surplus in the store. The loser of round one places four counters in as many consecutive holes on their side of the board as possible, and any remaining counters in the next hole. If this hole contains one, it is called puta, if two, naga, if three, wala. Holes with no counters are excluded from play for this round. If the loser has a puta hole, the opponent removes three counters from their hole opposite; if a naga, the opponent removes two from the opposite hole, if a wala, the opponent removes one. The removed counters go into their store. Puta and naga holes are marked with a piece of paper or straw in them. Empty holes are excluded from play in this round. The losing player begins the round, moving in the direction of the excluded holes, and played in the same way as the first round.  The player with empty holes begins play in the direction of the empty hole. Counters cannot be captured or sowed from puta or naga holes. Play continues as before.

When one player has fewer than twelve counters at the beginning of a round, they may arrange them differently at the beginning. They may put one or two counters in one end hole and not more than four in the other end hole, and one or two counters in the intermediate holes, leaving some empty and, thus, excluded. The opponent then puts four counters in each of their holes. There are no puta, naga, or wala holes in this round. The player with more counters plays as before, but the one with less has captures that are determined by the number of counters placed in the first end hole. If there were two in the end hole, the player captures when dropping the final counter into a hole to make it three; or when it makes two if there was one counter in the first end hole. Otherwise, the player does not sow in holes with one or two counters.

Main phase: Play begins from any hole on the player's side of the board with counters in it. Singletons cannot move. Sowing happens in an anti-clockwise direction. If the last counter lands in an empty hole, the turn is over

For capturing: Holes are in 'opposition' when one player has the front row hole occupied and the opponent has both of the holes opposite it occupied. If the last hole in a sowing is in opposition, the player takes the counters in both of the opponent's holes and places them in the empty hole from which the player lifted the counters. The player then sows the captured counters from this hole. Further captures in the sowing can occur in the same way. However, each player has two holes from which clockwise plays can be made: the leftmost hole in the outer row and the second from the left in the inner row. Clockwise moves can only be made from these holes if they immediately lead to a capture. When the captured counters are sown, starting from the same hole, they can also be sown clockwise if they lead to a capture. If they cannot lead to a capture, they are sown anti-clockwise. 

Another alternative the player has is that, if the player plays clockwise from one of these holes and therefore makes a capture, the captured counters may be placed in the hole and left there, and the player may play instead from the other hole from which clockwise captures are allowed in a clockwise direction, if it leads to a capture. 

The player may continue playing from this hole as above until the possibilities to move are exhausted, and then may move from any hole in an anti-clockwise direction. Multiple captures can only be made in a clockwise direction from these holes if it is made on the first sowing of the turn.

Players then move alternately. The first three turns are made by sowing from the holes with three holes, proceeding in order from the one furthest to the left, sowing two in the next hole and one in the following. They then sow from the next hole to the right with three counters on the next turn in the same way. Main phase: Play begins from any hole on the player's side of the board with counters in it. Singletons cannot move. Sowing happens in an anti-clockwise direction. If the last counter lands in an empty hole, the turn is over. For capturing: Holes are in 'opposition' when one player has the front row hole occupied and the opponent has both of the holes opposite it occupied. If the last hole in a sowing is in opposition, the player takes the counters in both of the opponent's holes and places them in the empty hole from which the player lifted the counters. The player then sows the captured counters from this hole. Further captures in the sowing can occur in the same way. However, each player has two hole from which clockwise plays can be made: the leftmost hole in the outer row and the second from the left in the inner row. Clockwise moves can only be made from these holes if they immediately lead to a capture. When the captured counters are sown, starting from the same hole, they can also be sown clockwise if they lead to a capture. If they cannot lead to a capture, they are sown anti-clockwise. Another alternative the player has is that, if the player plays clockwise from one of these holes and therefore makes a capture, the captured counters may be placed in the hole and left there, and the player may play instead from the other hole from which clockwise captures are allowed in a clockwise direction, if it leads to a capture. The player may continue playing from this hole as above until the possibilities to move are exhausted, and then may move from any hole in an anti-clockwise direction. Multiple captures can only be made in a clockwise direction from these holes if it is made on the first sowing of the turn. Otherwise, only one clockwise capture can be made and sowing must proceed in an anti-clockwise direction. If the last counter lands on a hole that is occupied but not in opposition, these counters are picked up and sowing continues.

Rules for sowing and capturing are the same as in the main phase of the game. The opening ends when both players reach an empty hole, and the first player to do so begins play in the main phase. Main phase: Play begins from any hole on the player's side of the board with counters in it. Singletons cannot move. Sowing happens in an anti-clockwise direction. If the last counter lands in an empty hole, the turn is over. For capturing: Holes are in 'opposition' when one player has the inner row hole occupied and the opponent has at least the opposite hole in the inner row occupied; if the outer row hole is also occupied it is also in opposition. However, if the opponent's inner row hole is empty and the outer row is occupied, it is not in opposition. If the last hole in a sowing falls into a hole that is is in opposition, the player takes the counters in the opponent's holes in opposition and places them in the outer row hole next to the hole from which the capture occurred. The player then sows the captured counters from this hole. If the capture is only of one counter, the contents of the appropriate outer row hole on the player's side are sown along with the one captured counter. Further captures in the sowing can occur in the same way. If a player can make a capture on the first sowing they must. Otherwise, they can choose any hole on their side to sow.

Counters are captured when the final counter lands in an occupied hole, making it contain 2, 4, 6, or 8 counters. When all of the counters have been captured, a second game begins. Each player fills their holes with the same number of counters as the beginning of the previous game. The player who has extra counters holds these in reserve. The other player will have either empty holes or one without the requisite number to fill the hole. Sowing cannot begin and captures cannot be made from these holes until the contents of these holes reaches the required number of counters to fill them. The second player in the first game now becomes the first player. Play continues with subsequent games until one player captures all the counters.

Each player starts with the following pieces, with their specialized moves: Shah (x1): moves orthogonally or diagonally one space; Wazir (x1): moves one space orthogonally; Firzan (x1) moves one space diagonally; Dabbaba (x2): jumps orthogonally to the third space; Tali'as (x2): moves diagonally two or more spaces; Jamal (x2): jumps diagonally one space then two orthogonally in the same direction; Zurafa (x2): moves diagonally one space then orthogonally three or more spaces; Pil (x2) jumps two spaces diagonally; Asb (x2): jumps one space diagonally and one space orthogonally in the same direction; Rukh(x2): moves any number of spaces orthogonally; Baidaq (x10); move orthogonally forward one space or diagonally forward one space to capture. Each Baidaq is assigned to one of the piece types and promotes to that piece. They are placed in the third rank, with the Baidaq al-Bayadiq on the leftmost square,  with the following promotion assignments for each regular Baidaq proceeding from left to right beginning on the second square from the left: Dabbaba, Jamal, Pil, Firzan, Shah, Wazir, Zurafa, Tali'as, Asb, Rukh.  Baidaq al-Bayadiq (x1), moves like a Baidaq, but does not promote immediately when it reaches the opposite edge. Instead, it waits there, immune to capture, until a situation arises where two of the opponent's pieces could theoretically be taken by a pawn. The Baidaq al-Bayadiq is then moved to that spot, any piece (including the player's own) being moved from that spot, and then the capture being made on the next turn. It then proceeds as before, and if it is to be promoted again, it becomes a Shah's Baidaq, and is replaced on the appropriate starting position. If it is promoted a third time, it becomes Shah Masnu'a, and the original Shah's Baidaq becomes Shahzada, and both move like the Shah.  If the Shah can be taken on the next turn, it is in Check and must not be in Check at the beginning of the next turn. If a Shah is not in Check but no legal moves are available, it is a Stalemate and the opponent wins. If the Shah is in Check and it is impossible to escape, Checkmate occurs and the opponent wins. Once per game, a player  may swap a Shah which is in Check or Stalemate with another of the player's pieces. If the player can place the Shah in the extra space on the opponent's side of the board, the game is a draw. The Shah cannot enter the extra space if the opponent's Shah Masnu's occupies it.

The Elephant moves any number of squares orthogonally. Moves are determined by dice roll: 5= pawn or king, 4= elephant, 3= horse, 2= ship. Captures are made by moving onto the space occupied by an opponent's piece. If a ship moves into a space to make a 2x2 square with only ships, it captures the other three ships.

The throws are as follows: Four white sides up = 4; four black sides up = 3; two white/two black up = 2; three white or three black = player loses their turn. Players continue to throw until they lose their turn. If a piece lands in the central hole, and it cannot move from it on its next opportunity, it is removed from the game. Pieces moving into the opponent's side of the board capture any of the opponent's pieces which occupy a space on which they land. When a piece reaches the end of the track, they proceed back in the other direction.

Each player owns the row closest to them and the half of the central row to their right. Play begins with three counters in each hole. During the first phase of the game, the players race each other (i.e., do not take turns) to be the first person to drop the last counter into an empty hole. Play moves from left to right in the row closest to the player, right to left in the central row, and left to right in the furthest row. Upon reaching the final hole in the opponent's row, play continues with the first hole in the player's own row. In the first phase, Players take counters from the leftmost hole in their row and sow them in the appropriate direction. When the final counter lands in a hole with counters, they are picked up and sowing continues until the last counter is dropped into an empty hole. Play continues in phase two in the same manner as before, but the players take turns and the player who ""won"" the first phase plays first. Players capture counters when placing the last counter of a sowing into one of their own holes which is empty. If the hole is on the left half of the board, any counters in the two holes of the opponent facing it are captured. If the last hole is on the right half of the board, any counters in the opponent's one hole facing it are captured. The player then continues to move using the last counter placed which effected the capture, and placing it in the next hole. This move can result in further captures (if the hole is empty), continuation of sowing (if there are counters in it), or the end of the turn (if hole is empty and there are no opponent's counters to be captured). Play continues until a player has no counters in their holes. The opponent then captures the remaining counters. Players then redistribute their counters, three in each hole, starting from the leftmost hole in their row in the direction of play. The player with fewer counters distributes all of their counters on the board, even if they cannot place three in the final hole of the counting. The player with more counters then places three counters in the same number of holes as the other player, taking any remaining as their winnings. Play continues in this fashion until one player captures all of the counters.

318,340,1415,Historical Information,,Three-player Gabata.,5,This ruleset was observed by R. Pankhurst in the area around Adowa and Aksum in Ethiopia. Either the Adowa or Aksum rules can be played with three players.,"Three players. One player controls a full row of six holes, which must be one of the outer rows, and the other two players each own two rows of three on the rest of the board. Play begins with three counters per hole. Sowing occurs in the following direction: from left to right in the outer row owned (or partly owned) by the player row, right to left in the player's half of the central row, proceeding to the opponent's outer row and sowing right to left, then left to right in the other opponent's part of the central row, then proceeding back to the outer row where the player began and proceeding as before. Sowing always begins from a player's own holes. When the last counter falls into an empty hole, the turn ends. If the last counter falls into an occupied hole, the contents of that hole are picked up and sowing continues. A hole is captured by dropping the last counter of a sowing into an opponent's hole which contains three counters, making it have four counters, and becomes a wegue. Captures cannot be made until after the original three counters placed in the holes at the beginning of the game have been moved. Once a wegue is created, the player cannot sow from it. When the final counter of a sowing lands in a wegue owned by the opponent, the player captures two counters from it. Play continues until all of the counters are captured or all of the counters are accumulated in wegue. A new round begins. Players then collect the counters in their captured holes. They count their takings by filling their holes with three counters each as in the beginning, and the player would own every hole they could fill with three counters. If the player has two counters remaining, they also gain another hole and the opponent surrenders their extra counter. At the end of play, if a player captures the opponent's single remaining hole as a wegue, the player captured three counters from it, leaving one for the opponent to continue to play. Play continues until one player cannot fill any holes.

Three counters per hole. Each player owns the row of holes closest to them, as well as the right half of the central row, with respect to their perspective. Sowing occurs from left to right in the player's complete row, right to left in the player's half of the central row, then continuing from right to left in the opponent's outer row, left to right in the opponent's holes in the central row, and then continuing as before into the player's outer row. In the opening phase, players play simultaneously. When the final counter of a sowing falls into an occupied hole, the contents are picked up and sowing continues. Each player plays until their final counter falls into an empty hole; the first player to do so begins the main phase. In the main phase, players alternate turns, and picking up the counters and continuing to sow when the final counter lands in an occupied hole, and stopping when the final counter lands in an empty hole. There are some restrictions with regard to sowing. Each of the player's three leftmost holes cannot be sown from to begin a turn if they contain three counters or less, unless there are no other options for play, in which case sowing must occur from a hole with one counter, and if none are available, then it must begin from a hole with two counters, or three counters if that is the only option. Separately, if the player's other holes only contain two or three counters, the player must play from a hole containing two counters, and these must be the option closest to the opponent's holes. Players must also play from holes containing more than three counters when available. During sowing, a player may not drop a counter into any of the opponent's holes which contain three counters (except when making a nedf, see below), skipping over them and sowing in the next available holes.  When the final counter of a sowing lands in a hole in the opponent's row containing three counters, this hole becomes a ""nedf."" Any counters falling into the nedf cannot be sown. Only one nedf can exist at one time. After the first nedf is made, any others can only be made by placing the final two counters of a sowing into holes which contain three counters, the penultimate hole becoming the new nedf. The player then continues their turn with the counters from the final hole. The hole after the nedf becomes the yazab tabaqi, or ""guardian."" While the yazab tabaqi contains exactly three counters, the opponent cannot create a new nedf. Play continues until one player has no counters to move, or concedes they can no longer make a nedf.",Pankhurst 1971: 165-166.,Horn of Africa,,,,"8°58'34.27""N, 38°45'29.98""E","5471,5471",0,,0,0

The players begin the game simultaneously sowing first from their rightmost hole, racing to be the first one to drop the last counter of a sowing into an empty hole. This player then begins the next phase where they alternate play. Sowing occurs in an anti-clockwise direction. When the final counter falls into an occupied hole, the contents of this hole are picked up and sowing continues. When the final counter lands into an empty hole in the row belonging to the player, the counters in the opposite hole belonging to the opponent are captured, and the counter that triggered the capture is moved to the following hole. This could trigger the further capture of more of the opponent's counters if the hole in which the counter is placed was empty and the opponent's opposite hole contains counters. If the hole is occupied, sowing continues. If the hole is empty and the opposite hole is unoccupied or it is one of the opponent's holes, sowing ends. When one player can no longer play because the holes on their side are empty, the opponent captures the remaining counters on the board. A new round begins. The losing player places three counters in each hole, beginning on the rightmost hole. If the player has remaining counters but cannot fill their holes with three, they must distribute the remainder to fill as many of the remaining holes as possible with at least one counter. The winning player from the previous round then matches this starting configuration, keeping any surplus for use in future rounds.

If the final counter falls into an occupied hole, these are picked up and sowing continues. If the final counter falls into an empty hole, the turn ends. At any time during the sowing, if a hole is made to contain four counters, the owner of the hole in which the four counters are located captures them, unless it is the final hole of the sowing, in which case the player who is sowing captures them. Play continues until a player can no longer move because there are no counters in their row, and the opponent captures the remaining counters. Players then count their pieces by placing four in each hole, and the player who has more than their original number takes ownership of one of the opponent's holes for every four counters more than the original number that have been taken.

Play begins with four counters in each hole. Players begin the game simultaneously, sowing according to the rules below, until one player drops their final counter into an empty hole. A player picks up the contents of any of their holes and sowing them in an anti-clockwise direction, picking up the contents of the last hole in which his counters fall, and continuing sowing. This continues until the last counter falls in an empty hole. Then it is the other player's turn. A hole is captured when the last ball is dropped into an opponent's hole containing three counters, making it four. A player cannot then take from one of these holes that they have captured. Therefore, the player cannot begin a turn from their own captured hole nor can they continue sowing from it. If the last counter of a sowing falls into an opponent's captured hole, nothing happens on the first instance, but every time after that, one of those counters are removed from the board and placed in the store, and the sowing continues with the contents of any of the player's holes. Ownership of a hole continues even if it becomes empty. When a player cannot move (i.e., there are no counters in their holes except any that are in captured holes), the opponent continues to move until the player is able to move. Play continues until all counters are either placed in the store or in captured holes and thus cannot be moved. Players then count their pieces by placing four in each hole, and the player who has more than their original number takes ownership of one of the opponent's holes for every four counters more than the original number that have been taken. If no player took four more than the original, the player with three extra gets the hole, if each player has two extra the weaker player is given the two extra counters.

Sowing occurs in a clockwise direction from the left half of a player's row, and anti-clockwise when played from the player's right half of the row. The first seed of sowing is placed in the hole from which the sowing began. When the final counter of a sowing falls into an occupied hole, and it now contains an even number of counters, these are captured, provided the contents of that hole have already been moved. Should the following hole also contain an even number of counters, these are also captured, as well as the next one, until there is a hole with an odd number of counters. If a player cannot move, they must pass until the opponent plays in such a way that they may play. If neither player is able to move, they both capture the counters in their rows. Players then count their counters by placing them six per hole. The player who has more counters than necessary to fill their holes places them aside for use in successive rounds. The player who is unable to fill a hole with six counters leaves it empty, also placing the extra counters aside for later use. This hole is not to be sown into. The player chooses which hole to leave empty. Subsequent rounds continue until one player cannot fill a hole with six counters.

They then take a counter from the next hole after that, and placing it in the next hole, continuing until there is an alternating pattern of a hole with five counters followed by a hole with three counters. The original hole from which the first counter was taken will have four counters. The player will then place the first counter taken into the next hole in the opponent's row, causing it to hold four counters. This creates a weg, a hole captured by that player, which is involved in capturing (see below). Players alternate making this first move in subsequent rounds. The next phase begins once this stylised move is completed. Sowing occurs in an anti-clockwise direction. If the final counter of a sowing falls into a hole containing counters, these are picked up and sowing continues. A player's turn ends when the final counter falls into an empty hole. When the final counter of a sowing falls into a hole containing three counters, it creates a weg, and the turn ends. Players cannot sow from a weg they've captured. A player may capture counters from an opponent's weg when the final counter of a sowing falls into the opponent's weg on the player's turn. The final counter and one counter in the weg are captured.

The main phase of the game begins, in which sowing continues in the same manner, but the player may begin their turn from any hole in their row. At the end of sowing, any holes containing four counters are captured by the owner of the row in which the hole is located, unless it is the hole in which the final counter fell, in which case the player captures them and the turn ends. If at the end of the game there are not sufficient counters to cause a hole to contain four, the players decide how the counters are allocated, and a new round begins. The players fill as many of their holes with four counters as they are able. The player with more counters will capture as many holes from the opponent in which they can place three or counters. If the player has two remaining counters after holes are filled with three, the opponent would cede their one remaining counter to the player to make three and the player captures one further hole.

Players draw lots to see who goes first. Players pick up the counters in any of the holes in their row and sow them in an anti-clockwise direction. If the last counter falls into a hole that is occupied, the player picks up the contents of this hole and continues to sow. When the last counter falls into an empty hole, the play ends. Capturing occurs when the last counter falls into a hole on the opponent's side of the board containing three counters, increasing it to four. This hole then belongs to the player who captured it. A player cannot pick up counters from this hole, and the opponent can only do so if the last counter of their sowing falls there, in which case the opponent takes one counter from it, along with the final counter. The captured hole remains in the ownership of the person who captured it. If it remains empty and the opponent drops their last counter into this hole, the last counter is removed. If a player cannot move, they pass, but the opponent may continue to make moves. The player could then resume play if the opponent's moves create a possibility for a move. Play ends when there are no more counters available to move. Each player owns the counters in their captured holes or which they have removed from the board. A second round is played, each player placing four counters into each hole starting from the rightmost hole in their row.

The fourth hole from the right in the inner rows of each player is larger and square. Total of 64 counters. Starting position: in the inner row, the first four holes, number of counters from the right: 0; 2; 2; 6. Play begins with each player alternately introducing the remaining counters in their holes. Each is introduced in such a way as to capture an opponent's counters, by placing it into an occupied hole which is opposite one of the opponent's occupied inner-row holes. The opponent's counters are then captured and sown along the inner row from either the leftmost or rightmost hole. If the capture occurs in the rightmost or leftmost holes in the inner row, or the hole immediately adjacent to them in the inner row, the counters must be sown from the leftmost or rightmost hole (whichever is closest), and sown along the inner row. Captures on these subsequent sowings happen according to the same rules as in the second phase, with certain exceptions explained below. If no capture is available, a counter may be placed in any occupied hole in the inner hole except the square hole, and sows them in either direction. If the square hole is the only occupied hole in the inner row, the counter is placed there and the player sows only two seeds from it in either direction. If a loaded square hole is reduced to six counters, the player places a counter there and sows the entire contents, forfeiting the special status for this hole for the rest of the game. Moves that start without a capture on the first sowing which end in the square hole stops there without further sowing. Sowing cannot start from a square hole except to capture, except as described above. If a sowing from an initial capturing move ends in an occupied square hole and no capture is possible, the player may choose to stop there or continue to sow. Once the contents of this hole have been relayed or captured the square hole loses its special status and the player may not introduce a counter into hole with one counter if there are other holes in the inner row containing multiple counters. Once all of the counters are introduced, second phase starts. Players move by sowing seeds from a player's holes. Sowing can happen in any direction, but must continue in that direction throughout the turn except in the special cases below. When the final counter of a sowing lands in a hole in the inner row and there are counters in the opponent's hole in the inner row opposite, these are captured. The captured counters are placed in the leftmost or rightmost hole of the inner row and sown along the inner row. The leftmost or rightmost hole is chosen based on which continues the sowing direction of the move that made the capture. If the capture occurs in the rightmost or leftmost holes in the inner row, or the hole immediately adjacent to them in the inner row, the counters must be sown from the leftmost or rightmost hole (whichever is closest), and sown along the inner row, even if this incurs a change of direction.

There are two sides: one with the king and 8 pieces, another with 16 undifferentiated pieces. The king begins on the castle space, and his associated pieces are arranged with two pieces on each orthogonal side of the king. The opposing side is arranged on the sides of the board, one piece on each of the three central squares on each of the four sides, and one further piece on the next row in on the central square of the row. Pieces move orthogonally any number of squares. Pieces cannot jump. If a piece is caught between two opposing pieces, it is removed from play. A piece may also be captured by trapping it between an enemy piece and the castle. The king, when in the castle, can only be captured when surrounded on four sides. If it is in a space adjacent to one of the sides, it can be captured when the opponent surrounds it on the remaining three sides. Otherwise, it is captured like any other piece.

Opening moves: Players place all of the counters in the outer row into their rightmost hole. They then take one counter from each of the holes in the inner row and redistribute them into the outer row, one in each hole. Then, each player sows counters in an anti-clockwise direction beginning from the rightmost hole in the inner row, proceeding, picking up the contents of holes when the last counter falls into an occupied hole and continuing sowing. However, the final counter that would fall into the rightmost hole in the outer row (which should now contain 17 counters) is not placed there, but rather on the second to right hole in the inner row, which should now contain one counter. Initial phase: In the initial phase, the rightmost hole in the inner and outer row for each player are out of play. All sowing and capturing only occurs on the remaining holes. Sowing occurs in an anti-clockwise direction. When the final counter of a sowing lands in an empty hole, the turn ends. When it falls into an occupied hole in the player's inner row the contents of the opponent's opposite holes in the inner and outer row are captured. These are then sown in the player's holes beginning with the hole from where the previous sowing began. If the final counter of a sowing falls into an occupied hole that cannot make a capture, then the counters in this hole are picked up and sowing continues. Second phase: The initial phase ends when a player plays from the rightmost hole in the outer row. This can be by necessity or by choice. Once this happens, that player must play in all of their holes. The opponent may remain in the initial phase after this point until they play from their rightmost hole.

The opponent moves first, but may flip the board around if they prefer that arrangement, sacrificing the first move. Counters are sowed in an anti-clockwise direction from a hole in the player's row. If the last counter falls into a hole making it odd, these are picked up and sowing continues. If it lands in a hole making it even, these counters are captured as are the ones in the opposite hole. If the previous hole also has an even number, these and the ones in the opposite hole are captured. If the last counter falls into an empty hole, the turn ends. If a player has no counters in their holes, the opponent must give them one counter, to be placed in the leftmost hole and played from there. Play ends when the board is cleared of counters. Each player counts the number of counters they captured. The player with more counters is given a score equal to the difference in the number of counters.

Pieces move forward only (straight forward or diagonally forward) one space per turn following the pattern on the board until they are crowned Mullah by reaching the last rank. A non-Mullah piece may capture an enemy piece by hopping over it. The capture can be in any direction. When a piece reaches the other player's rank, it is promoted to Mullah. The Mullah can move and capture in any direction. It can also move any number of spaces. The Mullah can also capture an enemy piece from any distance, and land anywhere behind the captured piece provided there are no other pieces (friendly or not) within the spaces of the leap.

The players refill their holes, beginning with their store, which receives five counters, and four in each other. Holes are only filled with exactly four counters, any extra are set aside.

Twenty pieces per player, arrayed on the dark-colored spaces. The square in the left-hand corner closest to the player is a dark square. Pieces move one space forward diagonally. When a piece arrives at the furthest rank opposite their starting position, it becomes a king. Kings may move diagonally, forward or backward, any number of spaces (like a bishop in Chess). Captures are made by hopping over an adjacent piece in a diagonal or orthogonal direction, including backwards. Multiple captures are allowed, in which the player may change direction. Kings capture by flying leap. Captures are mandatory, and the maximum capture should be made based on the value of pieces. Kings are worth less than twice the number of regular pieces, but more than twice the number of pieces minus one. (e.g., three kings are worth less than six pieces, but more than five pieces). If more than one maximum capture has the same value, the one that captures more kings takes precedence. It is permitted to use the same space more than once, but not to hop over the same piece twice. Captured pieces are removed after the turn is complete. The maximum capture can be enforced when the opponent catches it, though the opponent may opt not to point it out. A king cannot make three non-capturing moves in a row without moving another king or piece. This rule does not apply if the player only has one king remaining. If one player has only two kings remaining and the opponent has only one king remaining, the player with two kings must win in seven turns. If they do not, the game is a draw. If both players have only one king remaining and neither of them is able to capture or will be forced into a position where their king will be captured on the next turn, the game is a draw.

If a player can trap an enemy piece between two friendly pieces, the enemy piece is blocked and cannot be moved. 
On the next turn, instead of moving a piece, the player can capture the trapped piece by removing it from the board, provided his own two surrounding pieces are still free. The trapped piece is immediately free if one of its two enemies is itself surrounded.

At that point, white can either add another piece or move his piece on the board. A move must be a legal chess move and may not separate any element of the board; all pieces much remain touching, even if just diagonally, when a move has ended.

The points form a continuous track in a horseshoe shape; each player progresses in opposite directions (one from their bottom right to the top right, the other from their bottom left to their top left. Each player has 15 pieces. The starting position is as such, numbering the points from the origin of each player's track: Point six: five pieces. Point 8: three pieces. Point 13: five pieces. Point 24: two pieces. Play begins by each player rolling one die; the player who rolls the highest plays first, and then rolls again to begin play. Players move according to the number on each die by moving one piece the number on one die and another the number on the other die, or by moving one piece twice (once for each die). If doubles are rolled, the player must play the number on each die twice. Players cannot end their move on a point with multiple opposing pieces. If a player ends the turn on a point with one opposing piece, that piece is placed in the middle of the board (not on a point) and must reenter the board according the the next die roll, counting the origin point as a move of one. They cannot reenter on a point with two or more pieces. No other pieces can move until all of the pieces belonging to that player are removed from the center. When all of a player's pieces are on their final 6 points, they may start removing pieces from the board. They can do so by rolling a 6 to move from the 6th point, and so on down to 1. Players must use all available moves presented by the dice. The first player to remove all of their pieces wins. The winner gains one point, or two points if the opponent has pieces in their starting quadrant.

The second, fifth, and eighth squares (counting from the top) in the outer rows, and the third and sixth squares in the central row of each rectangle are marked. Can be played with sixteen, eight, or four players. It can be played individually, or on two teams. Each rectangle has one set of four pieces. They enter the board from the center, proceeding down the central row or their respective rectangles, proceeding in the outer rows of the rectangles in an anti-clockwise direction. When a complete circuit of the board has been made, the pieces must travel down the central row again and exit the board with an exact throw. The game is played with two eight-sided die, containing the following values: 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16 on one, 2, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 16 on the other. It may also be played with four rectangular dice each with the values 1, 3, 4, 6. Pieces are entered on the throw of nine. Doubles allow a second roll.Spaces moved may be broken up between two pieces but each piece must move a number equal to that displayed on one of the dice. A player can pass, but only before the die is thrown. When two pieces of the same color occupy a space, no other pieces may pass them. These pieces may then move as a single pawn. If a piece lands on the same spot occupied by an opponent's piece, the opponent's piece is sent back to the start. Two pieces moving as a single pawn can only be sent to start by two other pieces moving as a single pawn. Pieces on a marked space cannot be sent to start. A  play which sends an opponent's piece to start allows another roll. A player may bypass the central row and circuit the board another time if they wish (i.e., in order to send another player back to start to prevent them from winning).

Play begins with four counters in each hole. A player picks up the contents of any of their holes and sowing them in an anti-clockwise direction, picking up the contents of the last hole in which his counters fall, and continuing sowing. This continues until the last counter falls in an empty hole. Then it is the other player's turn. A hole is captured when the last ball is dropped into an opponent's hole containing three counters, making it four. A player cannot then take from one of these holes that they have captured. Therefore, the player cannot begin a turn from their own captured hole nor can they continue sowing from it. If the last counter of a sowing falls into an opponent's captured hole, nothing happens on the first instance, but every time after that, one of those counters are removed from the board and placed in the store, and the sowing ends. Ownership of a hole continues even if it becomes empty. When a player cannot move (i.e., there are no counters in their holes except any that are in captured holes), the opponent continues to move until the player is able to move. Play continues until all counters are either placed in the store or in captured holes and thus cannot be moved. Players then count their pieces by placing four in each hole, and the player who has more than their original number takes ownership of one of the opponent's holes for every four counters more than the original number that have been taken.

565,673,577,Default,,,1,,"The 32 pieces are shuffled and randomly allocated face-down to squares on the board. 

The first player turns up a piece to begin the game. The color of that first uncovered piece is the color he or she will play in the game. The second player then makes a move, and the two alternate until the game is finished.

There are three kinds of moves. A player may turn a piece face-up, move a piece, or capture an enemy piece. In some game variants, multiple captures may be made in one turn.

Turning a piece face-up is a legal move if there are any face-down pieces on the board. Once revealed, a piece may move, capture, or be captured. 

A player may only move face-up pieces of their own color.

Unlike Xiangqi, all pieces move identically: a piece may move only one square up, down, left, or right. A piece may never move onto a square that is already occupied unless such a move is a legal capture.

A player may only capture with a face-up piece of their own color, and may only capture a face-up piece of the opposing color. In all captures, the captured piece is removed from the board and its square is occupied by the capturing piece.

The pieces are ranked, forming a hierarchy with the general at the top and soldiers at the bottom. Only pieces of equal or lower rank may be captured, with one exception. For instance, a chariot may capture a horse, and the general may capture either, but a horse cannot capture a chariot, and neither can capture the general. The one exception concerns generals and soldiers: the general cannot capture soldiers, and soldiers can capture the general.

In the Hong Kong version, the pieces are ranked in this order: General>Chariot>Horse>Cannon, Advisor>Minster>Soldier. This ranking reflects the approximate value of the corresponding pieces in Xiangqi (though the relative rank of horse and cannon is arguable). All pieces capture exactly as they move: one square up, down, left, or right.

The game ends when a player cannot move, and that player is the loser. Most often, the game is lost because all of a player's pieces have been captured and so he has no pieces to move.

The game is turn-based. The player character and the robots start at randomly selected locations. Every time the player character moves a square in any direction (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), each robot moves one square closer to their new location, in whichever direction is the shortest path. If the player character collides with a robot, they die and the game ends.

The player attempts to survive by causing the robots to kill themselves by colliding with other objects on the map. When two robots collide each other a pile of rubble is created.

The player can also teleport into a randomly selected location. Teleportation counts as a move, and the robots will respond by moving towards the new location. Because the location is randomly selected, it is possible that the player teleports right into the path of a robot. A safe teleport is also possible for the player but can be used only a limited number of times.

The game is won when all of the robots are destroyed. 

In Ludii, the number of safe teleportations available is the score of the player. In clicking on the player a safe teleportation will be applied. To make a non safe teleportation, the button Pass has to be pressed.",,,,,,,"0,5520",0,,0,0

Whenever any holes in the player's row contain four counters, they are captured by the player. Play continues until all of the counters have been captured. A new round begins. The players count their captured counters. If the difference between the two players' captured counters is greater than five, for each multiple of five in the difference a hole on the player with fewer counters' side is eliminated from play, and the excess counters that equal a multiple of five are placed aside for use in further rounds if necessary. When the difference is less than five, and when dealing with the remaining pieces after the multiples of five are dealt with, The following scenarios apply. When one player has one counter and the other has four, the player with one will give their stone to the one with four, but the player who has one counter will receive one counter from the hole from which sowing begins at the beginning of each player's turn. When one player has two counters and the other has three, the player with two gives these counters to the other player. With these five, the player creates a ""bha"" from one of holes in their row.

Six cowrie shells used as dice: five are white and one is yellow. The number of the mouths which are face-up determine the value of the throw, except for a throw of 3 when one of the cowries with the mouth down is the yellow one, in which case the throw is known as So-hatara, and counts as 4, but allows special moves because it is actually considered four individual throws of 1. When the player throws 1, 5, or So-hatara, the player receives an extra throw. A 1, 5, or So-hatara must be thrown to enter a piece on the board. The entirety of a throw must be used to move one piece, but separate throws in a turn can each be used individually to move a different piece. This does not apply when So-hatara is one of the throws; in this case, the total of the throw can be subdivided however the player sees fit. Pieces enter the board from the center, moving down the central track of their arm, then in an anti-clockwise direction around the board, and then back up the central row of their arm of the board to the central square.

676,793,674,Default,,,1,,"Two players play on a board ruled into a grid of 5 ranks (rows) by 5 files (columns).

Each player has a set of 5 wedge-shaped pieces, of slightly different sizes. From largest to smallest (most to least powerful) they are: 1 king, 1 gold general, 1 silver general, 1 tokin, 1 pawn.

There is no promotion zone in Kyoto shogi. Every time a piece makes a move it alternately promotes and reverts to its unpromoted state. Promotion is effected by turning the piece over after it moves, revealing the name of its promoted rank; demotion is effected by turning the piece back.

The promotion rules and values are reminiscent of microshogi and entirely different from standard shogi: A king cannot promote. A tokin promotes to a lance and vice versa. A silver general promotes to a bishop and vice versa. A gold general promotes to a knight and vice versa. A pawn promotes to a rook and vice versa.

A piece is allowed to move, capture or be dropped in a manner that will prevent it from moving on a subsequent turn, which is illegal in standard shogi. For example, a rook can move onto the farthest rank, becoming a pawn and unable to move further. Such pieces may be captured as any other.

A captured piece may be dropped with either side facing up. There are no restrictions on where pieces can be dropped, other than that the square must be empty. So unlike in regular Shogi, pieces can be dropped in places where they can never move again, pawns can be dropped in files that already contain a pawn, and checkmate can be delivered through a pawn drop.

Players unstack the pieces by moving pieces off of the stack, but remaining on the same point, according to the throws of the dice. The value of the throw indicates the number of the point which can be unstacked. For example, a throw of 1 and 4 allows the player to unstack the pieces on points 1 and 4. Doubles allow players to only move one piece, but grant the player another throw. When all of a player's pieces are unstacked, they must be restacked, in the same way. When they have been successfully restacked, the player then bears off the pieces from this quadrant of the board. When bearing off, players move according to the number on each die by moving one piece the value on one die then another piece the value on the other die, or by moving one piece the value of one die and then the value of the other.

Play occurs on the intersections of the lines and the corners of the squares. Each player has nine pieces. Play begins with each player placing pieces on empty points. If they make three in a row along the lines, they can remove one of the opponent's pieces. They cannot remove an opponent's piece that is in a three-in-a-row formation. Once all pieces are placed, players take turns moving pieces one spot to an adjacent point along the lines. If a player makes three in a row, an opponent's piece is removed as in the first phase of the game. The game is won when the opponent is reduced to two pieces. A player may also win by blocking their opponent from being able to move.

There are four arcs in the corners of the ""square"". The points and lines are the playing spaces. Players play on two teams. One stick, serving as the playing piece, per team, which start one each on the parallel lines on the bottom side. Each team has a number of scoring sticks, determined at the beginning of the game. There are four throwing sticks, three are blank on one side and marked on the other, one stick, the sahe, is marked distinctively on two sides, marked with a green line on the flat side, while the others are marked red. The number of marked sides is the value of the throw, except when all are face up, which scores 6, and when only flat sides are up, which scores 10. Throws of 6 or 10 give the player another throw, as do throws of 1 and 3 if the sahe's marked side is up. All of the players on team throw before the players of the other team throw. Play begins from the middle of the river on one side. Each team moves in an opposite direction around the board. If a team's stick lands on the edge of the river opposite the starting position, the piece is sent back to start. If a player lands on the same space as the opposing team's stick, the opposing team's stick is sent back to start. When a team reaches the starting point, having completed a circuit of the board, the team wins a scoring stick. When one team captures all of the scoring sticks, they win.

732,851,723,Default,,,1,,"Goal: 
You try to both reduce the number of your own groups as much as possible, and also to block your opponent's ability to reduce his groups down to fewer than yours. Whoever decides to end the game must fill the empty spaces with opponent's pieces, and only then, wins by having equal or fewer groups.
            
Play:
Starting with the board empty, player's take turns placing a piece of their color on an empty position that does not abut any friendly piece. If it is impossible to place a piece, the player, instead, moves a piece to the first empty position in any direction. But whenever a new opportunity for placement is available, the turn must be used for placement.
            
Ending the Game:
            
The game ends at the choice of the player about to move, but only at the beginning of a turn in which there is no forced placement. 
            
Before scoring, the empty spaces are filled with the opponent's pieces. The player who ended the game wins unless the opponent has fewer groups. Because the empty spaces are filled with opponent's pieces, a player who ends the game too soon will lose. On the other hand, since ties go to the player who ends the game, it is important to end the game as soon as you can actually win.

733,852,724,Default,,,1,,"Wellisch Chess is played on a hexagonal board with each side having length 6 and each space oriented vertically. The board has 91 spaces. The board spaces are traditionally coloured red, yellow, and either gray or black.

Capture and Pawn Promotion:
  * When pieces other than Kings and Pawns are captured, they are set aside for later Pawn promotion. When a Pawn reaches the side of the board opposite its starting side, it is eligible for promotion.
  * When a Pawn is eligible for promotion, and there are pieces of that colour available from previous capture, then the Pawn is promoted to one of the captured pieces, as the player chooses.
  * If there are no pieces of the given colour when a Pawn reaches the far side, then the Pawn remains where it is (unless captured) until a piece of the given colour is captured. Then, on the player's next turn, the Pawn is promoted.

Piece Movement:
  * Rooks move as in Glinski Chess.
      - They slide in any of the 6 adjacent direction.
  * There are no Bishops in Wellisch Chess.
  * Kings can move one space in any of the six adjacent directions from their current space---West, East, or 60 degrees off either of those. They castle by swapping locations with one of the Rooks belonging to the same player. Castling can only take place when neither the King nor the Rook being moved have moved before.
  * Knights move one space 'diagonally' (i.e., along an edge, to any of the six nearest spaces of the same colour). Note that a Knight always moves to a space of the same colour as the space it moved from.
  * Queens can make any move that would be available to a Rook or a Knight on the current space.
  * Pawns can advance with or without capturing by moving one space forward to an adjacent space slightly left or right of forward. Pawns can never advance more than one space. There is no en passant capture. As mentioned above, Pawns can be promoted upon reaching the side of the board farthest from their starting side, but can only be promoted to a piece (Queen, Rook, or Knight) of the same colour that has already been captured. If a Pawn reaches the farthest side without any captured pieces available, then it remains in that position until a piece becomes available for its delayed promotion, on the player's next turn. (Note: Currently, on a turn where the delayed promotion takes place, the possible post-promotion movement of the Pawn is displayed before the promotion visually takes place.)

The game ends when a King is captured, or there is a stalemate due to turns elapsed without a capture or Pawn move.
  * When the game ends in checkmate, the checkmating player wins, the checkmated player loses, and the remaining player draws.
  * When the game ends in stalemate, all players draw. (Note: A player not being able to escape check passes the current move, This does not result in a stalemate.)

Variations: In Wellisch's version of the game, the first player to capture another's King takes possession of the other player's pieces. (The Pawns keep their direction of movement.) In another variant, some people play with a rule that if Player 1's move exposes a threat by Player 2 against Player 3's King, then Player 2 may not capture Player 3's King until Player 3 has had a chance to move.",,,,,,,"0,5520",0,,0,0

800,922,3,Kendall,,Standard rules proposed by Timothy Kendall.,6,These rules were compiled by Timothy Kendall for his commercially-sold version of Senet.,"Seven pieces per player, which begin on the board, alternating spaces from white to black along the track. Four throwing sticks, marked on one side and blank on the other, used as dice. The values of the throws are equal to the number of blank sides up, when no blank sides are up the throw = 5. Throws of 1, 4, and 5 grant the player another throw. All throws are made before moving, and a piece must move the full value of one throw at a time. Players alternate turns throwing the sticks, and the first one to throw 1 plays as white and moves the white piece in front. When a piece lands on a space occupied by the opponent's piece, the opponent's piece is sent back to the space where the piece that captured it moved from. When a player has two or more pieces in consecutive spaces, these pieces cannot be sent backward in this way. If a player cannot use a throw to move a piece forward, it must be used to move a piece backward. If a backward move makes a player's piece land on a space occupied by a piece belonging to the opponent, the opponent's piece is sent to the place where the player's move began. If a player cannot move, the turn ends. Spaces 26-30 provide special rules allowing the player to bear off. To move beyond square 26, the player must first land on it with an exact throw. From there, the player may: bear off with a throw of 5; move to square 30 with a throw of 4 and bear off on any subsequent throw; move to square 29 with a throw of 3, but it must stay there until borne off with a throw of 2; move to square 28 with a throw of 2, but it must stay there until borne off with a throw of 3. Pieces in squares 28 and 29 are never required to move backward and bearing off is not required from any space. When a player lands on squares 28-30 and an opponent's piece is already there, the opponent's piece is sent to square 27 instead of 26. When a piece is in square 27, whether by being sent there as described above or by being forced to use a throw of 1 to move into square 27, the player may either move the piece back to square 15 and lose one turn, or may leave the piece in square 27 until a 4 is thrown, bearing the piece off. A player cannot move any other piece on the board when one remains in square 27 or 15 after being sent back to it, and pieces which normally would be protected from bring sent back because they are next to each other may now be sent back. Pieces in squares 28-30 are safe as long as a piece is in square 27. The player in square 27 may decide to give up trying to throw a 4 on any turn and move this piece back to square 15 and lose their next turn. The first player to successfully bear off all their pieces wins.",Kendall 1979: rules book,,,,,"30°1'55.75""N, 31°4'31.13""E","530,3199",0,,0,0

Four sticks, with one flat and one round side, used as dice. The value of the throw is equal to the number of flat sides up; when all round sides are up the throw = 5. A throw of 5 grants the player another throw. Players may enter a piece onto the board with a throw of 1. When a piece is entered, another throw is granted which must be used to move that piece. Throws may be divided among the pieces on the board as a player sees fit. Splitting throws in this way cannot be used to enter a piece, but the throw which is granted to move an entered piece may be divided, as long as the entered pieces moves at least one space. Pieces cannot land on the same space. If a throw does not allow a piece to move forward, it must move backward. All pieces must move in the same direction during a turn. If it is impossible for a piece to move from square 1, it must be removed from the board and entered again. If a player cannot move forward or backward, the turn ends. Squares 15 and 26 grant the player an extra throw. If pieces land on these squares as a result of splitting a throw, that throw must be fully used before the new throw is taken. A piece which lands on square 27 is removed from the board and must enter again. Players must bear off the board by an exact throw. Pieces may not move backwards from squares 28, 29, or 30. Pieces are not required to bear off unless no other forward move is possible.

817,939,3,Jequier,Jéquier,Rules proposed by Gustave Jéquier.,6,These rules were proposed by the archareologist Gustave Jéquier.,"Five pieces per player. Pieces begin on the board on the first row of spaces, alternating white and then black. Four sticks used as dice, with one red side and one plain side. Throws are determined by the number of plain sides that land face up, when all red sides are up the throw = 6. Throws of 1, 4, and 6 grant the player another throw. Throws are played immediately after they are thrown. The first player to throw a 1 plays as black, moves the black piece in front of the line of pieces one space, and then continues to play. Pieces which are in their starting spots may not move until after the piece immediately in front of them has moved. Pieces may not move past a group of the opponent's pieces which are resting in three squares in a row. Pieces may land on a square with an opponent's piece, sending the opponent's piece back to the unoccupied space furthest from the end. However, if two or more of the opponent's pieces are in a row, these cannot be sent back in this way. Pieces on squares 26, 28, 29, and 20 are likewise safe from being sent back. If a piece cannot move forward, it must move backward to an open space. If no moves are possible, the turn ends. A piece landing in square 27 is sent back to the furthest unoccupied space from the end. Pieces cannot be borne off until all of the player's pieces are in the last row. Pieces moving beyond the final space are borne off the board. The first player to remove their pieces from the board wins. Points are awarded based on the number of the opponent's pieces which remain on the board, 1 for each in the final row, 2 for each in the middle row, 3 for each in the first row.",Jéquier 1930.,,,,,"30°1'55.75""N, 31°4'31.13""E","530,3199",0,,0,0

Four or five cowries are used as dice, with the value of the throw equalling the number of mouths which land face up. Players proceed in a clockwise direction around the board, until they reach the space before the one in which they began, moving to the marked square to the right of the direction of play, and proceeding around the inner square of spaces in an anti-clockwise direction, until arriving at the central space. When a player's piece lands on a space occupied by the opposing player, the opponent's piece is sent back to the starting point.

Five cowrie shells used as dice; the value of the throw equaling the number of the mouths which land face up. Players begin by entering their pieces onto the board from the square in the central row of the grid to their right. A single piece may be entered with a throw of 1, or all of the player's pieces may be entered with a throw of 5. Throws of 1 and 5 grant the player another throw, and pieces are moved only after all of the players throws are made. Play proceeds down the central row where the pieces entered, in an anti-clockwise direction until reaching the bottom right hand corner of the left grid, at which point the track continues on the opponent's side of the board from the top right corner of the left board (with respect to the current player), proceeding around the opponent's grids in an anti-clockwise direction until reaching the top left square of the opponent's right grid. At this point, the piece returns to the player's own right grid, on the bottom left corner, and proceeding in an anti-clockwise direction into the central row, and off the board once moving past the final space. When a player lands on a space occupied by an opponent's piece, the opponent's piece is removed from the board and must re-enter as before. Pieces are safe from being sent back when resting on the left two corners of each grid on the left and the right two corners of each grid on the right. The first player to remove all of their pieces from the board wins.

At the beginning of the game, the players choose whether to allow the fox the ability to make multiple captures in one turn. If the fox is able to capture but does not, the opponent adds another hen on an empty point in the bottom row. If there is no empty spot on the bottom row, the player waits until there is one to place the new hen. The fox wins by capturing all of the hens or by moving to the furthest line on the hens' side of the board. The hens win by blocking the fox from being able to move.

Players move according to the number on each die by moving one piece the value on one die then another piece the value on the other die, or by moving one piece the value of one die and then the value of the other. Once a player has borne off all of their pieces, they must re-enter them onto the points and replicate the starting position. The first player to bear off all their pieces and then place them in the starting position again wins.

Players take turns adding their stones to the board, one stone per turn. A player must never create a crosscut formation. Black makes the first placement of the game. If you have no more available placements, you forfeit your turn and your opponent can continue making placements until completing his goal connection. For White to win, White must form a contiguous sequence of white stones connecting the West edge to the East edge of the board. Each stone in the sequence must be connected to neighboring stones in the sequence by horizontal, vertical, or diagonal adjacencies. Likewise for Black and the North and South edges. A corner is considered to be part of both adjoining edges. Crossway makes use of the pie rule. This means Black makes the first placement, and White has the option of switching colors with Black, and claiming Black's first move as his own. If White chooses to exercise the pie rule, Black then becomes White and now makes the second placement of the game.

Each player has 15 pieces. The starting position is as such, numbering the points from the origin of each player's track: Point six: five pieces. Point 8: three pieces. Point 13: five pieces. Point 24: two pieces. Play begins by each player rolling one die; the player who rolls the highest plays first, and then rolls again to begin play. Players move according to the number on each die by moving one piece the number on one die and another the number on the other die, or by moving one piece twice (once for each die). If doubles are rolled, the player must play the number on each die twice. Players cannot end their move on a point with multiple opposing pieces. If a player ends the turn on a point with one opposing piece, that piece is placed in the middle of the board (not on a point) and must reenter the board according the the next die roll, counting the origin point as a move of one. They cannot reenter on a point with two or more pieces. No other pieces can move until all of the pieces belonging to that player are removed from the center. When all of a player's pieces are on their final six points, they may start removing pieces from the board. They can do so by rolling a 6 to move from the 6th point, and so on down to 1. Players must use all available moves presented by the dice. The first player to remove all of their pieces wins.

The two players, Black and White, take turns placing stones of their color onto unoccupied cells on the board. A group is a set of interconnected, like-colored stones. A group can be a singleton, a single stone which is not connected to any other stones of its color. A group includes all the stones of its own color connected to it. There are two types of moves - non-capturing placements and capturing placements. Non-capturing placements either forms no connections (adjacencies) with any stones, or forms one or more connections with only enemy stones. A non-capturing placement does not form any connection with stones of its own color. Making a non-capturing placement concludes your turn. When you place a stone which forms one or more connections with your own groups, you will create a new, larger group of your own stones. You can only make such a placement if said new group will have one or more connections with enemy groups upon its creation and if all said enemy groups are smaller than said new group. Upon making such a placement, all said enemy groups are removed from the board. After capturing one or more enemy groups and while it is still your turn, you must continue to add stones until you make a non-capturing placement, at which time your turn is concluded. If you have a placement available on your turn you must make one. If you don't have any placements available, you must pass your turn.

Players move according to the number on each die by moving one piece the value on one die then another piece the value on the other die, or by moving one piece the value of one die and then the value of the other. When doubles are thrown, the player may move the value of one of the die (n), n times (e.g., double sixes allows a player to move 6 six times, double twos allow a player to move 2 twice). Each player progresses in a clockwise direction around the board, to bear off upon reaching the final point on the opposite side of the board from which the player started. This first piece must reach the opposite quadrant of the board from where it started before the player may enter any other pieces. In the quadrant where the players enter their pieces, that player may only have two or more pieces on a point on a maximum of two points. When a piece lands on a point occupied by a single opponent's piece, The opponent's piece is removed from the board and must enter the board again.

Four players. Four pieces per player. Four seeds, with one white side and one dark side, used as dice. The values of the throws are equal to the number of white sides up, except when no white sides are up the throw equals 8. Throws of 1, 4, and 8 grant the player another throw. Players make all of the throws in their turn first, and then move the values of the throws individually. A player cannot subdivide the value of a single throw between pieces, but may move more than one piece in a turn if they have multiple throws, moving a piece the value of an entire throw. Pieces may only enter the board with a throw of 1. When a player has no pieces on the board, throws made before a throw of 1 do not count and cannot be played. Pieces enter on the marked square on the outer track of the square in front of the player. Pieces move anticlockwise around the outer squares of the board until they reach the square just before the square from which they started, then moving to the inner track and moving clockwise, and then onto the central square. Multiple pieces may occupy the same square. If a player's piece lands on a spot occupied by an opponent's piece, the opponent's piece is removed from the board and must be entered again. If the opponent has multiple pieces on this spot, they all are sent to the beginning. Sending an opponent's piece off the board grants the player another throw. Pieces on marked squares cannot be sent off the board. If a player has two pieces on the marked square on the opposite side of the board from the one in which they begin, the player may declare these as a twin which then play as one piece. Twins move half the value of a throw, rounding down. Twins may only be sent off the board by another twin. Twins may not send back to start a single piece belonging to an opponent. When sent off the board, the twins enter the board again as single pieces. When the twin reaches the central space, it becomes two single pieces again.

The standard options make Disc 'flip-captures' mandatory: This means that if a Disc is next to an opponent's piece which it can hop, then it must do so. The ownership of the hopped piece flips immediately. 

The same Disc may hop any number of available pieces, but may not, in any case, hop over the same location twice in the same turn. 

Depending on the (Options) chosen the Disc may, or may not, hop friendly pieces. Hopping friendly pieces is never required.

In some (Options) the hopped pieces also 'morph' between Disc and Hex. The (Options) also determine whose pieces morph and whose don't.

Except for Enemy flip-captures, all parts of a turn are optional and passing is allowed. But be careful about not making a placement during a turn, as this is an offer to end the game.

Placements:
Sites for placing Hexes have already been explained.
Sites for placing a Disc at the beginning of a turn, are given in the (Options). 
-- 'Non-Hex' means sites where Hexes are not allowed to be placed.
-- 'Safe' means not on sites where the next player's first action could be to hop-flip the Disc.
-- 'Any' means any empty site

The game ends when all the players have consecutively taken their turn without making a placement.

1045,1170,1012,Yut Nori,,Rules for Yut Nori.,5,Rules for Yut Nori.,"The game is played between two partners or two teams who play in turns, sometimes it is played with more teams. There is no limit in the number of participants in a game, which means that the game can be played by a considerable group. When played with large groups it is not uncommon for some group members never to cast the sticks: they still participate discussing the strategy.

The start of the game is determined by each team casting the yut-sticks. The team with the highest score starts first.

Each team then casts the sticks in turn, then moves a mal according to the score achieved. One turn usually consists of only one cast. However, a player achieving a yut or mo earns an extra cast for the turn; if he/she casts a yut or mo at the second cast, he/she earns an extra cast again, so there is no limit to the number of times a player can cast again before the end of a turn, provided he or she keeps casting yuts or mos. The respective scores can be played separately if wished, each given to another mal (or group of mals, see below), but a score earned from one cast cannot be split into two moves—for example, a geol (advance three steps) cannot be split into a do (one step) and a gae (two steps).


The four possible courses of the game of Yut
As long as there are mals outside the board, a team can either put a new mal onto the board according to the scores it got, or move a mal already on the board. The mals travel around the board and can move forward only. However, when landing on one of the big stations (in the corner and the centre), the team can choose to take the shorter way should they wish to. There are four possible courses, the default course being longest one with no abbreviation (No. 4).

If a mal lands on a station occupied by the opponent's team, the opponent's mal is removed from the course and returned to the starting position, and the current player is allowed to cast again.

If a mal lands on a station occupied by the own team, these mals can form a group and travel together from that point on.  However, this bears a risk: If an opponent lands their mal on a station occupied by a group of mals of the opponent, all mals in the group are removed from the course.

For example, if one casts two yuts and one do at his/her first turn in the game, possible moves would include (see The Stations below for the station names):

Put a mal on the board at the yut station (uses the first yut score); advance to mo (uses the do score), then to sok-yut (uses the second yut).
Put a mal on the board at the yut station (uses first yut score); put another mal on the board at the same yut station (uses the second yut score), causing the two mals to move together from then on; advance them to mo (uses the do).
Put a mal on the board at the yut station (uses the first yut); advance to duet-geol (uses the second yut), then to duet-yut (uses the do).
The game is won by the team who brings all their mals home first, that is complete the course with all their mals. A course is completed if a mal passes the station where the game is started (cham-meoki). Landing on cham-meoki is no finish, but any score going ""beyond"" this station completes a home run. Yut is often played for three or more wins.

1: You score 1 point every time you make a placement that closes off an odd number of tied rhombuses. (A rhombus is closed off when it is adjacent to no rhombus that can be filled in on a future turn.) This is equivalent to dividing tied cells between you in a ""one for me, one for you, one for me""-fashion as they are closed off.

1060,1185,1027,Default,,,1,,"Ex nihilo is a game for 2 players played with stackable pieces of two colors on the cells of a hexagonal arrangement of hexagons (a hexhex board). The board starts out empty. The game is over as soon as one player is unable to make a move. The other player is then the winner.

Even though the goal is technically stalemate, out of the interlocking mechanics emerges a territorial goal with a constant threat of a clever check mate turning the tide or ending the game before territory is settled.

The novelty of this game lies in its central gimmick: Every move consists in moving a stack. In this sense it is a pure movement game. Yet, the game features both placement and captures.

Movement – overview:
Stacks move along straight open lines and grow when they move away from the center cell. This game is unusual in allowing movement of stacks containing 0 pieces. It is by growing these that pieces get onto the board in the first place.

Movement – details:
On your turn, you must move a stack not topped by an enemy piece to an empty cell reachable through an unbroken line of empty cells. By convention, a single piece is considered a stack of size 1 and an empty cell is considered to contain a stack of size 0.

If, after you have moved a stack, it is farther away from the center cell than before it was moved (measured in number of steps), its size is increased by 1 per step further away from the center it now is. This happens automatically in Ludii.

You may move a proper part of a stack by splitting it. To move a part of a stack, drag the piece that will be the bottom piece of the new stack to its destination, or click it, then the destination.

You may also move a whole stack, but only on the condition that you move it farther away from the center cell. A consequence is that moving a whole stack always results in its size increasing. Together with the convention that empty cells contain stacks of size 0, this also has the consequence that you can effectively place a new stack on the board by moving a stack of size 0. In Ludii a 0-stack is represented by a grey disc. You move it by dragging it to where you want to go, or click it, then the destination.

Note that nothing special happens to the cell you moved the 0-stack from – it still contains a 0-stack.

Capturing - overview:
Flanked enemy stacks are captured by being taken hostage for a move. Capturing is obligatory: If a capturing move is available, a capturing move must be made.

Capturing - details:
If (and only if) the top piece of a stack is of your color, it is said to partake in flanking an enemy stack if (i) this enemy stack is exactly in the middle of a line of otherwise empty cells going from the flanking stack to another one of your stacks, and (ii) all three of these stacks are of the same size.

If, after you have moved a stack, it partakes in flanking one or more enemy stacks, you must immediately move one of these enemy stacks. Except for the obvious difference that you are moving an enemy stack, all normal rules apply to this move. For example: If the captured stack grows (if you move it farther away from the center cell, that is), it grows by the addition of pieces of your color, so situations where this hostage move must itself be a capturing move are possible. Such chaining of captures must continue until you capture a stack that is not in a position to continue the chain. Growing captured stacks is the only way to take ownership of them more permanently.",,,,,,,"0,5520",0,,0,0

The general is to the right of center, and the cannon is to the left of center. One square above the general, the chariots, horses and elephants are placed to the left and right. the footsoldiers are placed in front. This is roughly similar to Chinese chess. The pieces are three-dimensional and have no characters on them. The general is carved like a pagoda as a sign of respect for Buddhism. The elephant is carved like a camel or bear, because in the meandering frontiers of the north, there are no elephants. There are many footsoldiers, because there is strength in numbers. There are no scholars, because they are not valued. The pieces are not placed on the lines but on the squares because this would be more secure. The horse always moves sideways for six squares, and the camel sideways for nine. This is because a camel is faster than a horse. Pieces can go all over the board, and there is no river boundary. This is to follow the water and grasses for pastures. The footsoldier moves on square forward each time to the last rank. It captures an enemy piece in front by moving diagonally. After it has gone...it...move backwards, and is promoted to chariot. This is to commend its merit.

The Suffragettes are colored green, and the large pieces are distinguished as Leaders of the Suffragette Party. The Police Forceis colored dark blue, and the large pieces are distinguished as Inspectors of Police. The Suffragettes are placed on the squares marked ‘S’ near ‘Albert Hall.’ The leaders ofthe party are positioned as follows: One leader is placed in the middle of the front row, and the other four Leaders are placed at the ends of the front and second rows. The Police Force is placed upon the squares marked ‘P’ near the House of Commons. One Inspector is placed in the middle of the front row, and the remaining four Inspectors at the ends of the front and second rows.

Each player alternatively moves or hops one of his or her own pieces. Moving can result in moving to one space into a single adjacent square, hopping over your own pieces to move farther along the board, or hopping over an opponent’s piece to 'arrest' or 'disable' your opponent’s piece. A piece may move horizontally or diagonally one square a turn into any of the 8 adjoining squares, but that square must be unoccupied.  Pieces may freely move over any part of the board except:

a.) No piece can be moved (except when arrested or disabled) onto the spaces marked Prison, Prison Yard [PY], Hospital, or Hospital Grounds [HG].

b.) A Suffragette cannot move onto the spaces marked Albert Hall [AH]. 

c.) A Policeman cannot move onto the spaces marked House of Commons [HC].

On a player’s turn, they may hop a piece rather than move it a single square. Hopping means jumping over one of your own pieces into the unoccupied squareon the other side of the hopped over piece (as in Checkers). A player may string together hops into multiple jumps, provided that each jump lands in a permitted zone (as listed above) and there is a space in between each piece hopped over. If the square behind a piece is occupied, the hop cannot be completed. Any piece having gained entrance into their opponent’s House of Commons or Albert Hall may move about freely on the squares representing the building, but must not move or hop away from those squares. Moving within either the House of Commons or Albert Hall spends a player’s turn.

Properly hopping over your opponent’s pieces results in arresting or disabling your opponent’s piece(s). Police may arrest Suffragettes and Suffragettes may disable Police through jiu jitsu. Disable is a term used in jiu jitsu when an opponent is neutralized. Any piece standing on one of the squares in The Arena (squares marked pink) is liable to be arrested or disabled by their opponent. Any of your pieces may arrest or disable your opponent’spieces. A Suffragette disables the Police by hopping over him in a diagonal direction. A Leader of the Suffragette Partycan disable any member of the Police Force by hopping over him in any direction. A Policeman arrests a Suffragette by hopping over her in a diagonal direction. An Inspector of Police arrests any Suffragette member by hopping over her in any direction. A piece can only arrest or disable its opponents when it is hopping, not when simply moving. Thus, one of the smaller pieces may hop over a Leader or Inspector simply to move about the board. A single piece may arrest or disable multiple pieces during one series of jumps. Suffragettes who are arrested are moved to the Prison. Police who are disabled are moved to the Hospital. No piece can be arrested or disabled on yellow squares outside the Arena, but may move or hop freely on these squares.

If at any point, the Prison andthe Hospital each contain 12 or more inmates, either player may propose a release. The other player accept or reject this. If accepted the proposer moves one of their disabled pieces to the Prison Yard [PY] or Hospital Grounds [HG] as appropriate. Then the other player does the same but the piece chosen must be of the same value as the one the proposer released. The proposer cannot release a major piece if the other player does not have any disabled major pieces. This is repeated until either the Prison Yard and Hospital Grounds are full or the proposer passes. No exchange can be proposed while any piece remains on the Prison Yard or the Hospital Grounds.",,,,,,,"0,5520",0,,0,0

Two to twelve players, who play on two equal teams. The number of pieces per team is equal to the number of holes in one row. One team plays as pieces of camel dung, the other as sticks. The pieces begin, one in each hole, in the outer rows of the board. Eight sticks, used as dice, with a marked side and a blank side. The values of the throws are equal to the number of marked sides which land face up. A throw of 4 grants the player another throw. Pieces can only be moved for the first time with a throw of 1 or 8. One piece may move one space on a throw of 1, or eight pieces may each move one space on a throw of 8. Once a piece has made its initial move, it may move according to the throws of the sticks. The bottom team's pieces move from right to left in the home row, left to right in the next row, right to left in the third row, and then into the opponent's home row. The top team moves left to right (from their perspective) in their home row, right to left in the next row, left to right in the next row, and into the bottom player's home row. When a team's piece lands on a space in the central two rows occupied by an opponent's piece, the opponent's piece is captured. Pieces cannot be captured in the home rows. When a piece moves into the opponent's home row, they move back into the central two rows, moving in the opposite direction as before. After moving into the home row a piece can no longer be captured, even when it is in the central two rows.

1094,1224,1066,Default,,,1,,"Objective
            Each player tries to achieve a majority of territory.
            Objectively, territory means a player's pieces on a filled board when no captures are left to be made. 
            
            However, as implemented, territory is a score which is based on a reading of each occupied cell and its neighbors to see who would own that cell if the opponent were allowed a neighboring placement and a chance to capture there. 
            Empty cells are scored as a player's territory that player's piece would be safe there, but the opponent's stone would not, even with another stone added to help it.
            
            In general this underestimates objective territory except in the case of chain captures. 
            To prevent ending the game while chain captures are pending, a player must exceed the majority count by 3 to win, unless no moves are left.
            
            Definitions:
            - The vicinity of a site is that site, together with all the sites immediately adjacent to it.
            - The action-potential of a site is the number of the moving player's stones in the site's vicinity minus the number of the opponent's stones there. For example, the action-potential of a site on Black's move is 3 if its vicinity contains either: 5 Black and 2 White, 4 Black and 1 White, or 3 Black and no White.
            
            The structure of the game:
            Before play begins, one player places a Black stone and two White stones on three different sites. 
            Then the other player decides to play either as Black or as White. 
                       
            A standard setup is provided by default. To choose other positions, select the Pie option from the menu.
            
            After the player's colors are determined, player alternate turns with each taking two moves in succession on their turn, beginning with Black.  
            
            Moves:
            A move begins on a site that has sufficient action-potential to be completed (calculated as described above). 
            Before movement, the following amounts are deducted from the action-potential, based on the site's contents:
            
            -- No deduction is taken if the site is already occupied by your own stone.
            -- If the site is occupied by the enemy, you deduct 2 actions to remove and replace it with your stone.
            -- If the site is empty, you deduct one action to add one of your own stones, with the following exception:
            ---- The empty-site deduction is waived if there is no other empty site next to the chosen site and the action-potential at that site is zero.
                        
            When you select a site, the application will calculate these deductions for you, and if there is any remaining action potential, it will be shown on the transparent stone.
            
            You may use this leftover actions potential, to move the stone at that site, in a sequence of steps and jumps; spending one action for each space moved during the sequence.
            -- A step is a move to an adjacent empty site.
            -- A jump is a movement in a straight line over occupied sites.
            The distance along the path traveled may not exceed the number of actions that remain.
            
            The application accepts a click on the final destination of the stone. It calculates whether the destination can be reached according to the rules. If you click on the current site or a site at an intermediate distance, the move will end there.
            
            Voluntary passing and partial passing are allowed.
            
            The following rule to keep the game progressing must be obeyed when ever possible:
            -- A player must add or capture whenever that player has not added a piece within the last 3 moves (i.e. at least once in 2 turns.)
            
            Ending the game:
            The game ends when the two scores add up to the size of the board, or when the score of one player exceeds half the board plus a safety factor of 3. 
            The score is based on:
             1 point for each friendly piece unless: 
             A. It could be captured by the opponent if an opponent's piece were added next to it, or 
             B. It could not be defended against capture by adding a friendly piece after 2 opponent's pieces were added next to it.
             
             1 point for each opponent's piece that can be captured, even if all the rest of the empty sites around it are filled with opponent's pieces
             (this purposely underestimates the territory)
             
             1 point for each empty space where both A: and B: below are true,
             A: if a friendly piece were placed there, it would be secure no matter how many additional opponent's pieces were placed next to it. 
             B: if an opponent's piece were placed there and on an adjacent empty site, one of them could be captured if the remaining sites around them were filled with friendly pieces.
             
             This method ends the game when one player has a clear advantage.",,,,,,,"0,5520",0,,0,0

If a player starts with an odd move, they must end with an even move (and vice versa) and use all their remaining counters. The game ends when a player has used all of their holes, and placed all of their counters in the sixth hole on their side. If a player cannot place their counters according to the rules of the game, they lose.",DLP evidence.,Senegal,,,,"15°16'19.49""N, 15°17'17.45""W","5285,5287",0,,0,1

1133,1270,1113,Default,,,1,,"Cage is a checkers variant for two players played on a square 10x10 board. In this implementation you also have the option of playing on smaller boards. In the initial position, 50 checkers of one color and 50 checkers of a different color fill up the board in a checkered pattern. The goal of the game is to capture all your opponent's checkers.

On your turn, if you can, you must choose one of two different kinds of moves to perform:
• a single step, or
• a sequence of jumps.
Note: A single jump is considered a jump sequence of length 1.

Universal restriction:
All moves are subject to the following restriction:
• At no time may a checker be orthogonally adjacent to a checker of the same color.

Stepping:
Stepping is moving one of your checkers to an orthogonally or diagonally adjacent empty square, and this kind of move is subject to the following two additional restrictions:
• A step my never bring the number of orthogonal enemy neighbors of the moved checker down to 0.
• The only condition under which a step may fail to bring the moved checker closer to the center of the line you are moving along is if it brings its number of orthogonal enemy neighbors up from 0.

(Some elaboration on this last restriction: In general, a step must decrease the moved checker's straight line distance to the board's central intersection. That's the same as bringing it closer to the center of the orthogonal or diagonal line you are moving along. (Note: The center of a diagonal line is an intersection if it is an even number of squares long, and a square otherwise. The center of an orthogonal line is an edge if it is an even number of squares long, and a square otherwise.) Here is a different way of putting it: Whatever diagonal or orthogonal line you are stepping along, the largest distance to an edge square on this line before the step must be bigger than the largest distance to an edge square on the same line after the step. The only exception to this rule, as explained in the last restriction, is if your checker has no orthogonal neighbors and can step into such a relationship – then you may step in any direction.)

Jumping sequences:
If a checker of your color is orthogonally adjacent to an enemy checker, and immediately on the opposite side of that enemy checker is either an empty square or the outside of the board, your checker may initiate a sequence of jumps. You do this by jumping your checker over to the opposite side of the enemy checker and immediately removing the jumped piece. If your checker lands outside the board, it too is removed from the board. Note: If your last checker is removed when you capture your opponent's last checker, you still win.

If the jumping checker lands in a position where it can jump again, your turn does not end, and the checker must make yet a jump. If there are several ways to continue the sequence, you may choose freely between these. The sequence of jumps only ends when the checker lands on a square where it can make no further jump.",,,,,,,"0,5520",0,,0,0

On a turn either: 
1. Pass (sometimes this is forced); or 

2. Place a goat on an empty cell that is not too close to another goat of its color: 
-- If they are in line, they need gap of 2 or 3 spaces (as selected in Options.)

-- the step must reduce your goat's net contact with enemy goats.  

Exception: Moves using rule 4. are not allowed immediately after the previous player has passed.

 - <i>White</i> (the Persians) has orthodox chess pieces in standard spaces: 2 Rooks (A1, H1); 2 Knights (B1, G1); 2 Bishops (C1, F1); 1 Queen (D1); 1 King (E1); 8 Pawns (A2-H2).
 - <i>Black</i> (the Spartans) has: 2 Lieutenants (A8, H8); 1 General (B8); 1 Warlord (G8); 2 Kings (C8, F8); 2 Captains (D8, E8); 8 Hoplites (A7-H7).
<b>The Moves</b>
 - <i>Pawns</i> can move (but not capture) one space forward. On their first move they can move two spaces forward. They capture one space diagonally forward. There is no en passant rule.
 - <i>Rooks</i> can move and capture any number of spaces orthogonally.
 - <i>Bishops</i> can move and capture any number of spaces diagonally.
 - <i>Knights</i> can move one space orthogonally with one space forward diagonally leaping over intervening pieces and capturing what they land on.
 - The <i>Queen</i> can move and capture any number of spaces orthogonally or diagonally.
 - <i>Kings</i> can move and capture one space orthogonally or diagonally.
 - <i>Lieutenants</i> (shown as crosses) can move and capture diagonally upto two spaces, jumping over any piece if necessary. They can also move (but not capture) one space sideways.
 - The <i>General</i> (shown as an upside-down rook) can move and capture any number of spaces orthogonally or one space diagonally.
 - The <i>Warlord</i> (shown as an upside-down bishop) can move and capture any number of spaces diagonally or like a knight.
 - <i>Captains</i> (shown as squares) can move and capture upto spaces orthogonally and may jump if necessary.
 - <i>Hoplites</i> (shown as an upside-down pawns) can move (but not capture) one space diagonally forward. On their first move they can move two spaces diagonally forward, jumping if necessary. They capture one space forward.
<b>Winning</b>
The Spartan and Persian have different victory conditions.
<i>Spartan Victory</i>: The Spartan wins when the Persian King is checkmated as in orthodox chess.
<i>Persians Victory</i>: The Persian wins once one of the Spartan Kings is captured and the remaining Spartan King is checkmated or when both Spartan Kings are placed under simultaneous attack (duple-check) and neither King can be removed from attack on the next move (Duple-Check and Mate).
<b>First Move</b>
The Persians, being the aggressors historically and White, always move first.
<b>Check Immunity</b>
When the Spartan has two Kings in play a Spartan King is immune from check. Thus, the Spartan may move a King onto an enemy attacked square, leave a King under attack or move a piece that would expose a King to attack.
<b>Duple-Check & Mate</b>
If both Spartan Kings are placed under simultaneous attack this is a form of check called duple-check. It is illegal for the Spartan to make a move that will place both of his Kings underattack. With both Kings under attack, the Spartan loses if on his move he is unable to remove at least one King from attack. In such case the game ends in checkmate.
<b>Promotion</b>
A hoplite, upon reaching its 8th rank, may promote to any Spartan piece including a King but only if the Spartan has only one king in play.
A pawn, upon reaching its 8th rank, may promote to any Persian piece apart from the King.
<b>Capturing en passant</b>
There is no capturing en passant in Spartan Chess.
<b>Castling</b>
Spartan Kings may not castle. Persian Kings may castle as normal.",,,,,,,"0,5520",0,,0,0

Played on an 8x8 board with pieces with specialized moves: Pawns (8): can move one space orthogonally forward, or two steps orthogonally forward on their first move, capture one space diagonally forward; Rooks (2): can move any number of spaces orthogonally; Bishops (2): can move any number of spaces diagonally; Knight (2): moves in any direction, one space orthogonally with one space forward diagonally; Queens (1): can move any number of spaces orthogonally or diagonally, cannot capture another Queen; Kings (1): can move one space orthogonally or diagonally, but on the first turn may move two squares provided it is not currently in check. The King cannot capture with this move. Castling, En Passant, and Pawn promotion allowed. Pawns promote to Queens when reaching the last row on the board only if that player's Queen has already been captured. An opponent's piece is captured by moving a player's own piece onto a space occupied by the opponent's piece. When a King can be captured on the next turn by an opponent's piece, it is in check. The King must not be in check at the end of the player's turn. If this is not possible, it is checkmate and the opponent wins. If the opponent is reduced to only a king, it is considered a win. Stalemate is also a win for the player causing the stalemate.

            <b>Movement Restrictions:</b>
            
            Humans may travel across plains, forests, and shallow water. They may also move 1 space into mountains instead of their regular movement.
            Vehicles may travel across plains. They may also move 1 space into forests or shallow water instead of their regular movement.
            Aircraft may travel across all spaces.
            Boats may travel across shallow and deep water.
            Buildings cannot move (obviously).
            Units cannot move over enemy or neutral occupied spaces.
            
            //------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            <b>Damage Calculation:</b>
            
            An attacking unit deals damage equal to its health, multiplied by its damage factor. 
            For example, A submarine has a damage factor of 80%, so a submarine with 20 health will deal 16 damage when it attacks (20 x 0.8).
            If the defending unit is in shallow or deep water, it takes 25% more damage.
            If the defending unit is in a forest, it takes 25% less damage.
            Aircraft are unaffected by terrain when calculating damage against them.
            All damage values are rounded down to the nearest whole number.
            
            //------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            <b>Fog of War:</b> (Optional)
            
            All friendly units and buildings can see tiles up to 2 spaces away.
            Aircraft can see tiles up to 3 spaces away.
            Boats can see shallow and deep water tiles up to 3 spaces away.
            Humans on a mountain can see tiles up to 3 spaces away.
            Forest and mountain tiles can only be seen if adjacent to them.
            Enemy units and buildings that are not visible cannot be attacked, and have their type and health hidden.
            
            //------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An opponent's piece is captured by moving a player's own piece onto a space occupied by the opponent's piece. When a King can be captured on the next turn by an opponent's piece, it is in check. The King must not be in check at the end of the player's turn. If this is not possible, it is checkmate and the opponent wins.

A King cannot castle if it has ever been checked. Players capture pieces by moving onto a space occupied by an opponent's piece. A player must say 'Gardez la reine' (Guard the Queen) when the queen is threatened. When a King can be captured on the next turn by an opponent's piece, it is in check.

When a Padati reaches the opposite edge of the board, it is promoted to a Mantri and is moved immediately to the space it last moved from. An opponent's piece is captured by moving one of the player's own pieces onto the space occupied by the opponent's piece. If the Raja can be captured on the opponent's next turn, it is in check. The Raja cannot be in check at the end of the player's turn. If this is impossible, the opponent wins. When a player is reduced to only their Raja and Padati, the opponent wins.

1323,1470,1312,Main Chator (Selangor),,Rules played in Selangor.,3,Rules for Main Chator as played in Selangor.,"Played on an 8x8 board with pieces with specialized moves. The pieces are as follows, and placed on the outer rank in the following order, starting from the left corner and moving in, with the placement mirrored on the right side (the Mantri is placed to the right of the Rajah): Tor (2): can move any number of spaces orthogonally; Kudah (2): moves in any direction, one space orthogonally with one space forward diagonally, jumping over any intervening pieces; Gajah (2): can move any number of spaces diagonally; Rajah (1): can move one space orthogonally or diagonally; Mantri (1): can move any number of spaces orthogonally or diagonally; Bidah (8), placed in front of the other pieces: can move one space forward, or one space diagonally to capture. A Bidah may move two squares on its first move. Bidahs may capture en passant only when it is blocked from moving forward by another of the opponent's Bidahs; the blocked Bidah has the option in this scenario of capturing with an en passant move, with the option of capturing either of the two Bidahs in question.
The Rajah, for its first move may move like a Kudah as long as it has never been checked. 

Players capture pieces by moving onto a space occupied by an opponent's piece. 

Castling occurs by moving the Rajah to the left or the right two squares, regardless of any intervening pieces; the Tor is not moved as part of this move. 

Promotion of Bidahs occur when they reach the opposite edge of the board, but only immediately if they reach the Tor's square. If it captures on the square next to the Tor's square, from the square in front of the Tor's square, it must move backward diagonally to the square in front of the Tor's square on a subsequent turn and continue before promotion. A Bidah reaching the Kudah's square must move backward diagonally once, to the right or left, before being promoted; a Bidah reaching the Gajah's square must move backward diagonally right or left two spaces, and a Bidah reaching the Raja or Mantri's square must move backward diagonally three squares before being promoted. Bidah's can be promoted to whatever piece the player wishes. 

If the Rajah can be captured on the opponent's next turn, it is in check. The Rajah must not be in check at the end of the player's turn. If this is impossible, it is checkmate and the opponent wins. 

If a player is reduced to only their Rajah, it can make the move of any piece.

However, a player may place two pieces on any point after the twelfth point, regardless of whether a piece has ever landed on the twelfth point. A player cannot move a piece onto a point containing two or more pieces belonging to the opponent. When a piece lands on a point occupied by a single piece belonging to the opponent, it is removed from the board and must be entered again, and can only do so using the value of one die, not both, with the starting point considered to be point 1, the next point 2, etc. Opponent's pieces can be removed from the board in this way when reentering the board. To win, a player must place their pieces in one of the following winning positions: five pieces on each of the final three points; three pieces on the final five points; seven on the final point, five on the penultimate point, and three on the antepenultimate point; fifteen on the final point. If none of these positions are possible, the player must bear off all of their pieces once all of their pieces have reached the final six points.

Players alternate turns moving their pieces diagonally one space forward to an empty space. A piece may capture an opponent's piece by hopping over it to an empty space on the opposite side of the opponent's piece, in a forward direction only. When pieces are captured, they are placed underneath the piece making the capture, forming a stack, controlled by the player whose piece is on top, the ""commander."" When a stack is captured, the commander is captured and the capturing piece becomes the commander, thus reducing the stack by one. The piece which is now on top of the stack now becomes the commander of that stack. Stacks always move together and cannot be broken apart. Capturing is compulsory when it is possible. There is no obligation to capture the maximum number of pieces. A player who captures the commmander of a stack can only capture from the same stack in the same turn again if there is another intervening capture between the two captures from the stack. When a piece reaches the opposite end of the board from where it started, it becomes a king immediately. If it its promoted in the midst of a sequence of captures, it may begin to capture as a king immediately when it is promoted. Kings move any number of spaces in either direction. Kings may capture by hopping over any distance, as long as there are no intervening pieces, and may land on any space beyond the captured piece, as long as the move is in a straight line and the captured piece is the only piece in the line. When a king is capturing and there is a choice for where it ends its capturing leap, an option which allows further captures must be taken if possible. Kings retain their rank when in a stack. Stacks move according to the rank of its commander.

One player has a gold fleet consisting of one large flagship and twelve escorts, with the objective of evading capture while breaking through his or her opponent's blockade to transport the flagship to the perimeter of the board. The other player has a silver fleet of twenty ships, and forms a blockade to trap the gold flagship and destroy the gold fleet's escorts with the objective of capturing the flagship.

Setup
Gold player places the flagship on the center square of the game board, and positions the rest of the ships anywhere within the boldly ruled central area of the board.

Silver player then positions the silver ships on twenty squares in the lightly ruled peripheral area of the board.

Play
Gold player chooses who goes first. Players move alternately by making two moves or one capture anywhere on the board. When the flagship is moved, only one move or capture is made (thus only the flagship).

Moves
A player may move two of the smaller playing pieces any number of vacant squares either horizontally or vertically on the board (as a rook in Chess, except that no captures can be made with this move), although if the flagship is moved, the gold player may not move another playing piece.

Captures
A player may move any playing piece (including the flagship) one square diagonally to capture one of his opponent's playing pieces. (This move is similar to the capture-move of the pawn in Chess, except that captures can be made on any of the four diagonals.)

This game uses displacement capture (like Chess), rather than custodial capture (like Hnefatafl), thus when a capture is made, the captured piece is removed from the board and the vacated square is occupied by the captor.

1401,1552,1380,Default,,,1,,"Overview:
In Seesaw the players (North and South) command opposing armies with soldiers that can promote. Your army starts out as a single soldier and your promotion area evolves as you deploy more soldiers. Every time a soldier promotes it grows - first into a 2-stack, then a 3-stack, and so on. 

The central idea of Seesaw is the 2-fold significance of stack-size: 
(i) Odd-sized stacks move forwards and even-sized stacks move backwards, and 
(ii) on any given turn, a stack can take as many steps as it likes from 1 up to its size. 

This results in soldiers seesawing up and down the board as their strength increases to the point where the game is forced to conclude in one side completely eliminating the other.

How to play:
On your turn, you must either make a stack-move, or place a new stack. 

1. Placing a new stack: 
A newly placed stack will always be of size 1. You may only place a stack on an empty cell next to a cell of your color. These cells are promotion cells, and each cell you place a new stack on automatically turns into a promotion cell of your color.

2. Stackmoves:
You only ever move one stack per turn, but that stack may be able to move several steps or capture several enemiy stacks, depending on its size.
The number of steps a stack may take is the number of pieces in it, i.e. its size.

2.1 Noncapturing moves: On turns where you do not have to capture an enemy (see below) all the steps a stack takes is either constrained to the 3 upward directions or to the 3 downward directions, depending on the size and the owner of the stack. South's forward directions are the 3 upward directions, and North's forward directions are the 3 downward directions.

2.2 Capturing moves: If one or more of your stacks can reach an enemy by lifting the restraint on direction, you must capture such a reachable enemy by replacement. If that stack did not spend all its steps reaching the captured enemy, you can, before you end your turn, spend the left-over steps by making a noncapturing move. However, if yet an enemy is in range immediately after you have captured (counting only the steps left over), you must capture again.

3. Promoting: Your odd-sized stacks promote when they end up on a promotion cell belonging to your opponent at the end of your turn. Your even-sized stacks promote when they end up on a promotion cell belonging to you at the end of your turn.

The object of Seesaw is to capture all your opponent's soldiers. More precisely: If, at the end of your turn, your opponent has no stacks on the board, you have won the game.",,,,,,,"0,5520",0,,0,0

Group: like-colored stones adjacent to each other. Singletons are considered groups of size 1.
Path: an empty point, or an uninterrupted straight line of empty points that have a pair of like-colored stones on both ends, which are not part of the same group. Such a pair is said to have a path.
Dead group: a group in which all stones belonging to it have no path. If any stone belonging to a group has a path, the group is said to have a path.

GAME PLAY (Overview)
Decide which player plays as which color (Light or Dark) in any adequate way.
Light goes first, then alternate turns.
On each player's first turn, players place a stone of their own color on any empty point.
On each player's second turn, players place another stone of their color so that their own two stones have a path.

Then players take actions below on each turn, in this order.
1. Remove all opponent’s dead groups. This happens automatically in Ludii.
2. Place a stone of their own color on an empty point that is on at least one same straight line with an existing friendly stone, and no opponent's stone in between. Passing is not allowed.

After the second turn, the player with no stones of their color on the board at the beginning of their turn loses.",,,,,,,"0,5520",0,,0,0

1416,1567,1393,Bao,,Rules for Bao.,3,Rules played in Zanzibar.,"4x8 board. One hole, the Nyumba, is square, and is the hole immediately to the right of center in the player's inner row. The holes on both ends of both players' inner rows are Kichwa, and the next holes in from those are the Kimbi. Players sow from one of their holes in either direction on the board. When the final counter lands in an occupied hole, these counters are picked up and sowing continues, when a capture is not possible. When the final counter lands in an empty hole, the turn ends.  Play begins with six counters in the Nyumba, two in each of the holes to its right, and 22 counters to be entered on the board.

Namua is the stage of the game where there are still counters to be placed on the board. During Namua, the Nyumba is the house, as long as it has at least six counters in it and it has not been emptied. Players place counters into an occupied hole in their front row. If this hole is opposite one of the opponent's occupied holes, the opponent's counters in that hole are captured. Captures must be made if possible. If a capture is not possible, the counter is placed into a hole and the contents of that hole are sown. The house cannot be emptied, but if it is the only occupied hole, the counter placed into it, and only that one counter, can be sown to one of the adjacent holes.  Sowing from a Kichwa in the direction of the back row is not allowed unless it is the only occupied hole in the front row. Players cannot place a counter in holes with single counters  unless only holes in the front row with single counters exist or the house is still present. If the final counter of a sowing lands in the house, the turn ends. Once all of the counters are placed on the board for both players, Namua ends.

The next stage begins. The rules for the house mentioned above during the Namua stage no longer apply, but the rules below remain in effect until the first capture in this phase of the game has been made.  Players alternate turns taking the counters from one of their holes that has more than one and less than sixteen counters and sowing them. When the final counter lands in an occupied hole in the front row opposite one of the opponent's occupied holes, the opponent's counters are captured, unless the hole from which sowing began contained sixteen or more counters. Captures must be made if possible. Single counters cannot be sown. Sowing must occur from an inner row hole when possible. A Kichwa cannot be sown toward the back row if it is the only occupied hole in the front row. 


Capturing rules:  The counters captured from the opponent's hole are captured and sown on the player's front row. If they were captured from a Kimbi or Kichwa, they must be sown from the nearest Kichwa. If they were not captured from one of these holes, they must be sown from the Kichwa in the direction toward which the sowing was proceeding when the capture was made. If the capture was not made from a Kimbi or Kichwa and it was not made while sowing, the player can choose which Kichwa to sow from. Further captures in the same turn must be made with this sowing if possible, and are made if the final counter lands in an occupied hole in the inner row which is opposite an occupied hole in the opponent's inner row. If a capture is not possible, the sowing must end in the house. When the final counter lands in the house, the player may choose to continue sowing from the house or to end their turn. If the player cannot capture and cannot drop the final counter in the house, they must sow into an occupied hole, and continue sowing from that hole. The player may sow such that the final counter lands in an empty hole only when none of the other options are possible.

When a player sows in such a way that they do not capture and the opponent is unable to capture on their next turn but the player will be able to capture on their own following move, the opponent cannot sow from this hole. The opponent is able to sow from such a hole if they can capture from this hole; if the hole in question is the house (this remains true for all phases of the game); if it is the only occupied hole in the front row; or if it is the only hole in the front row with greater than one counter. This rule does not apply during the Namua phase.

A player wins when their opponent's inner row holes are empty. This includes in the middle of sowing (e.g., sowing into the outer row directly from a Kichwa when it is the only occupied hole in the front row). A player may also lose if they only  have single counters in their holes. ",de Voogt 1995: 35-51.,Zanzibar,,,,"6°48'9.39""S, 39°17'2.17""E","5490,5494",0,,0,0

Three pieces per player, each having one father, one mother, and one djinn, which all begin on the first space. The track is boustrophedon, starting in the bottom left corner and moving to the right, until it reaches the top right corner where it proceeds down the extended track. Six sticks, used as dice, with one polished side and one rough side. Throws equal the number of polished sides which land face-up, with the following exceptions: five polished or five rough sides = sig, this grants a move of one plus another throw, in which the player moves the number of polished sides up, six polished = sig of 6, grants the player another throw, and the player moves the number of polished sides up; if the second throw is regular sig, the value is 7, six rough = sig of twelve, grants the player three throws and the player moves the number of polished sides up; if any of those three extra throws are a regular sig, the total value of the extra throws is 13. Pieces move one at a time from the starting space. The first piece to move is the father, the second the djinn, and the third is the mother. The djinn moves twice the value of the throw in any space that does not require a sig to move through it. A player must throw a regular sig to leave the starting space; when they do, they move one space and throw again. When a player passes the piece of an opponent, the opponent's piece returns to the starting space and must enter the board according to the same rules. Certain spaces require a throw of sig to move into and out of them. This means that the move of 1 given by the regular sig can be used to do this, but the extra throw granted by it does not; however, the total value awarded by a sig of six or twelve does count. These are the Minaret, and all of the spaces in the extended track. If a player cannot enter a space because their is not a sig attached to their throw, they stop their move at the point before it. The space for Cairo counts for three of the value of the throw. When a piece reaches Mecca and there is still value left in the throw, the next piece may be entered and moved using the remaining moves left in the throw.

The players take turns placing one piece on any vacant square. In this phase no captures are made.
When all the pieces have been placed, the players take turns moving pieces on the board. The pieces can be moved orthogonally to any adjacent square. A piece can leap over any single piece of either color, if the square behind is unoccupied. Several leaps in one turn are possible (as in Draughts).
If a player can trap an enemy piece between two friendly pieces, the enemy piece is blocked and cannot be moved.
On the next turn, instead of moving a piece, the player can capture the trapped piece by removing it from the board, provided his own two surrounding pieces are still free. The trapped piece is immediately free if one of its two enemies is itself surrounded.
A player can only move a piece between two of the opponent's pieces if this move causes one of the opponent's pieces to be trapped.

1493,1646,1432,Default,,,1,,"In Seesaw Draughts, when a man reaches the rank farthest away in its stepping direction, its capture range is increased and it changes the direction it steps in. It can thereby promote again if it reaches the opposite rank.
            
            The mechanism is implemented like this: All men are stacks. Single pieces are stacks of size 1. Every time a man promotes a piece is added to it, so it's stack size increases by 1. The following two-fold meaning of stack size is the key idea:
            1) Odd stacks step forwards and even stacks step backwards.
            2) A stack of size n can capture a piece up to n steps away in a straight line provided that there are no pieces between the capturing piece and its target, and that the square immediately behind the target in the capture direction is empty. The capturing piece must land there.
            
            Thus, the men gradually acquire the capturing power of a king in Thai Checkers as they seesaw up and down the board.
            
            There is no obligation to choose the capture sequence that maximizes the number of pieces captured. We deem this calculation a bit too demanding when a stack's range is a function of its size.

            First move by Black is a free placement to any cell. 
            
            Thereafter each player places a series of stones, one for each of the opponent's groups, on empty cells adjacent to only the respective group.

            The application starts a player's turn by making every opponent's stone transparent. Groups that will be removed at the end of the turn are given a reddish hue. As stones are placed, the associated group turns back to a solid color to show that no more stones may be played next to it.
            
            When the last stone has been placed the red tinted stones immediately disappear and the process begins again for the next player.
            
            Scoring:
            Scores are calculated by imagining that at the begining of a turn the red tinted stones have been removed. Then the remaining stones are counted by player, together with the spaces that they enclose. Spaces that are adjacent to both players, or connected to both players by a series of adjacent empty cells, are not counted.
            
            The application keeps this count for you.  When the count no longer changes after both players have taken their turns the game officially ends.  The result is normally clear well in advance, but may require careful checking for groups that don't contain a single-cell eye.

    Definitions:
    A Net is all of a player's stones and the connections between them.
    Connections include: 
    -- 1. stones on adjacent hexes, 
    -- 2. stones diagonally adjacent (even if the two hexes between then are occupied by the opponent)
    -- 3. stones on opposite sides of an empty space: The empty space is treated as being part of the net.
    
    Regions: A player's Net separates the other player's stones into distinct regions. The stones in each region are a distinct group. No path from one group can reach another group without crossing the net.
    -- Caution: Adjacent stones, cut between by a diagonal connection, are normally NOT part of the same group.
    
    The stones in a group are not necessarily connected, but they live or die together. To live, the region they are in must have MORE edge cells than stones -- equivalently: more empty edge cells than interior stones. 
    
    Note that any empty edge cells that are part of the opponent's net are not part of the region.
    
    To Net: Means to place a stone that reduces the edge liberties of a region, which contains the opponent's stones, to such a degree that the available edge cells (liberties) no longer exceeds the number stones contained in the region. Netting an opponent's stones wins the game.
    
    Netting can be done by filling the edges, or by cutting off connections to part or all of the edge -- for example by placing 3 stones in a triangle around an individual piece.
    
    Suicide: is a placement of your own stone into a region defined by the opponent's net, bringing your stone count there up to the number of edges cells in the region.

A General is made by placing any single piece on top of an orthogonally adjacent piece, and a King is made by placing any single piece on top of an orthogonally adjacent General. 

- Soldiers move orthogonally one step to an adjacent square.
- Generals move any distance in a straight line orthogonally, like a Chess Rook.
- The King moves one step to any adjacent square, like a Chess King

Capture is compulsory if possible.

- A Soldier or King captures by jumping over an enemy piece occupying a square to which it can legally move and landing on the square immediately beyond it in the same direction, provided that the landing square is vacant.
- A General captures in the same way, but may move any number of vacant squares before the captured piece, and  may land on any successive vacant square in line of travel beyond the captured piece.

If the capturing piece can then make another capture, it must, and it must continue doing so until all possible consecutive captures have been made. An enemy piece can only be jumped once in a single turn. If it is reached a second time it forms a block and ends the turn. At the end of a capturing turn all captured pieces must be removed from the board before the next player moves.

If more than one capture is possible you must choose that which captures the greatest number of pieces, counting a King as three, a General as two, and a Soldier as one. If two possible capturing moves offer an equal number of pieces, you may freely choose between them.

If one or more of your Generals is captured in one turn, you may create just one General (not more) from two orthogonally adjacent Soldiers anywhere on the board.

If your King is captured you must, if possible, use your next turn to create another King by placing a Soldier on top of an adjacent General.

1510,1663,1450,Ikibuguzo (Opening 2),,Played in Bugufi and Burundi.,3,These rules were played in Burundi and the Bugufi area of Tanzania in the early twentieth century.,"4x8 board. Two counters in each hole. Opening play:  Players rearrange their counters so that there are four counters in each hole of their outer row. If they play with the second array, they take turns sowing from each of the holes with four  counters, beginning with the rightmost hole, placing two in the first hole and one in each of the following. Main phase: Play begins from any hole on the player's side of the board with counters in it. Singletons cannot move. Sowing happens in an anti-clockwise direction. If the last counter lands in an empty hole, the turn is over. For capturing: Holes are in 'opposition' when one player has the front row hole occupied and the opponent has both of the holes opposite it occupied. If the last hole in a sowing is in opposition, the player takes the counters in both of the opponent's holes and places them in the empty hole from which the player lifted the counters. The player then sows the captured counters from this hole. Further captures in the sowing can occur in the same way. However, each player has two hole from which clockwise plays can be made: the leftmost hole in the outer row and the second from the left in the inner row. Clockwise moves can only be made from these holes if they immediately lead to a capture. When the captured counters are sown, starting from the same hole, they can also be sown clockwise if they lead to a capture. If they cannot lead to a capture, they are sown anti-clockwise. Another alternative the player has is that, if the player plays clockwise from one of these holes and therefore makes a capture, the captured counters may be placed in the hole and left there, and the player may play instead from the other hole from which clockwise captures are allowed in a clockwise direction, if it leads to a capture. The player may continue playing from this hole as above until the possibilities to move are exhausted, and then may move from any hole in an anti-clockwise direction. Multiple captures can only be made in a clockwise direction from these holes if it is made on the first sowing of the turn. Otherwise, only one clockwise capture can be made and sowing must proceed in an anti-clockwise direction. If the last counter lands on a hole that is occupied but not in opposition, these counters are picked up and sowing continues. Play ends when one player captures all the opponent's counters or one player cannot play. The player who cannot play loses. A player may also win by capturing the counters from both of the opponent's end holes in the inner row in a single turn.

Play
- Decide which player will play with which color (Dark or Light).
- Light is the first player to play.
- Players take turns moving one of their own pieces
- Passing is not allowed.

Ending the game:
The game ends when one player's pieces all form a single group. That player wins. If tied, the moving player wins.

Note: The Game 'Constellation' can also end in Stalemate if a player cannot move. In this case the last to move loses.

How to make a move:
1) Choose a piece to play.
2) Note the size of the first friendly group in each direction. (If the piece is not a singleton, one of these is the group the piece is part.)
3) The largest of these gives the starting value for the move.
4) Try to move the chosen piece in any of the six radial directions.
-- (In Astralesce, as the piece moves it will capture every opponent's piece that it reaches.)
5) For the piece to be able to move, it must stop on a destination at which it has a higher value than before.
-- The ending value is found in the same way as the starting value was found: It is the size of largest of the nearest friendly groups on a radial line from the new location.


Notes on what to look for to find moves quickly:
A) move to join the largest group in-line with the piece.
B) If the piece is already in the largest in-line group, then move to connect that group to another.
C) move to join a non-in-line group that is at least as big as the largest in-line group
D) move to connect 2 groups to make the result larger than the largest in-line group
E) find the all the lines radiating from all pieces of all groups that are larger than the largest in-line group, and move to a location on one of those lines.",,,,,,,"0,5520",0,,0,0

Pieces move as follows: Raja (King, x1): moves one space in any direction; Mantri (Minister, placed to the left of the Raja, x1): moves any distance orthogonally or diagonally; Queen (x1, placed to the right of the Raja); moves orthogonally one space; Prince (placed to the left of the Minister, x1), moves orthogonally or diagonally any distance; Ushtra (Camel, x2): moves diagonally any distance; Chariot (x2), moves orthogonally any distance; Flagcar (x2), moves diagonally any distance; Vaha (Horse, x2): move orthogonally one space and then diagonally another, jumping over any intervening pieces; Danti (Elephant, x2): moves orthogonally any distance. Padati (Pawn, x14): move forward orthogonally one space or one space diagonally forward to capture. When a Padati reaches the opposite edge of the board, it is promoted to a Mantri and is moved immediately to the space it last moved from. An opponent's piece is captured by moving one of the player's own pieces onto the space occupied by the opponent's piece. If the Raja can be captured on the opponent's next turn, it is in check. The Raja cannot be in check at the end of the player's turn. If this is impossible, the opponent wins. When a player is reduced to only their Raja and Padati, the opponent wins. In the case of a stalemate, the player in stalemate may remove any of the opponent's pieces (except their Raja).

- the square's midpoint is unoccupied.

The capture is executed by placing a piece on the remaining unoccupied corner of the square. If the capturing move also simultaneously completes a second square on the board where the same conditions prevail, then the move results in the capture of four enemy pieces instead of two.

(To offset any advantage Black has in moving first, the pie rule is used: White can choose to switch sides after Black's first move, playing from then on as Black. White has this option only after Black's first move.) 

The game is executed in two phases:

1) Placement phase. Players take turns placing one of their pieces on any open point on the board. No placements result in a capture in this phase. A player can win the game in this phase if they are able to occupy all four corners of a board square; otherwise, play proceeds to the Movement phase once all 24 pieces have been placed.

2) Movement phase. For their turn, a player may either:
- move one of their pieces along a straight line to an adjacent empty point; or,
- remove a neutral piece from the board—but only if no white or black piece is adjacent to it.

Capturing moves are possible in the Movement phase. If the points of a triangle contain exactly one white and one black piece, either player can capture the opponent piece by occupying the remaining open point (""cornering"" the enemy piece on the triangle). 

If a move simultaneously corners two opponent pieces on two different triangles, then neither enemy piece is captured. A piece can move safely to a triangle point even if the other two points of the triangle are occupied by enemy pieces.

A player wins by being the first to occupy all four corners (points) of a board square with their pieces.

1. Starting a game:
- Each player takes 7 chips of one color.
- No two players may start with the same color chips.
- This player places a chip onto the playing area, and selects any other player to be the next person to move.

2. Playing the game:
- Move by playing a chip of any color onto the playing area (starting a new pile), or on top of any existing chip(s) in the playing area.
- If no chips are captured (see below), the player selects the next person to move, so long as that person's starting chip color is not in the stack just played on (this may be the same person, if that person used a captured chip). However, if all four colors are in the stack just played on, the next person must be the player whose most-recently played chip (by color) is furthest down in the stack
- Chips are captured by playing two chips of the same color consecutively on one pile. The player designated by that color must kill one chip of their choice out of that pile, and take the rest. Then they get the next move. Killed chips are taken out of the game.
- A chip is a prisoner when held by a player other than the original owner.
- Any prisoner in a player's possession may be killed or transferred to another player at any time. Such transfers are unconditional and cannot be retracted. A player may not transfer or kill chips of their own color.
- A player is defeated when given the move, but has no chips in their possession (and hence is unable to play).
  a. Defeat is not final until every player holding prisoners has refused to rescue the defeated player by transferring chips.
  b. After defeat, the move returns to the player who gave the defeated player the move.
  c. The defeated player's chips remain in play as prisoners, but are ignored in determining the order of play.
  d. If a pile is captured by the chips of a defeated player, the entire pile is killed, and the move rebounds to the capturing player.

3. Order of play:
- If a capture occurs: the player whose color made the capture gets the next move.
- If a player is defeated: move returns to the player who gave the defeated player the move. If this should also defeat that player in turn, whoever gave that player the move will get the next turn, etc.
- Otherwise, the next player to move is decided by last player to have moved as follows:
  a. They may give the move to any player (including themselves) whose color is not represented in the pile just played upon.
  b. If all players are represented in that pile, the move goes to the player whose most-recently played chip is furthest down in the pile.

4.Winning the game:
- The winner is the last surviving player (after the others have been defeated).
- A player can win even if they hold no chips and all of their chips have been killed.",,,,,,,"0,5520",0,,0,0

(Pieces like rooks and queens however may move across it, e.g. from d1 to f1.) However, no captures are made, and check is disregarded. Then, after this move, the player may, if he can, have a piece kick the ball.

A piece can kick the ball if the ball is adjacent to it (i.e., a kings move away.) The ball moves in the same way as the piece that kicks the ball, and the ball must be moved directly away from the piece. Also, the ball cannot be moved to or over occupied squares (except when a knight kicks the ball). For instance, a rook on a3 can kick a ball on a4 to squares a5, a6, a7, a8, a9, as long as the ball isn't moved to an occupied square; but a rook on a3 cannot kick a ball on b4.

A knight can kick the ball to any square, a knight-move away from the square where the ball was before the kick, but not to a square, adjacent to the knight.

When the ball is kicked to a square adjacent to another piece of the same player, the player may make another kick. This is called a `pass'.

E.g., A stone on b3, allows that player to move any stone in the next board one step to the left. A stone on e5 allows any stone in the next board to move two steps diagonally to the top right.

Each player moves one ship each turn. A ship moves any number of empty squares in a straight line, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally (that is, like a chess queen). However, a ship may never end its turn in its home port.

DESTROYING SHIPS
Two opposing ships ""attack"" each other if they face each other along a straight line with no other ships between them (so that each could move to the other's square). A ship that is under attack from three or more enemy ships is ""vulnerable."" At the end of your move, you must destroy all vulnerable enemy ships by removing them from the board. In the example below, the white ship on b3 is under attack from black ships on
a2, b1, and d3, and can be destroyed. You can only destroy enemy ships after your move. Sometimes, if an enemy ship
is vulnerable at the beginning of your turn, your move in that turn will make it no longer vulnerable. When this happens, you cannot destroy the ship. If the destruction of one ship makes another ship vulnerable that wasn't vulnerable before, both ships must be destroyed. In the example below, destroying the white ship on f8 makes the ship on g8 vulnerable. Both are destroyed.

REBUILDING SHIPS
At the beginning of your turn, you may rebuild one of your destroyed ships. The ship is placed in your home port, and since ships may not end a turn in their own port, you must use your turn to move the ship out of port. Therefore, you cannot rebuild a ship until you have a vacant square to move the ship to.

The object is either to form a line of three of your pieces, orthogonally or diagonally with no intervening spaces, or to capture six enemy pieces (i.e. reduce your enemy’s forces to two so that he cannot win).",,,,,,,"0,5520",0,,0,0

Ten counters in each large space, with five in each smaller space. Sowing occurs in an anti-clockwise direction. When a counter falls in an occupied space, the contents of the following space are picked up and sowing continues. If the following space is one of the large spaces, one of the counters from the large space is picked up and sown into the next space. When the following space is empty, if there is another space following the empty space the turn ends. If the space following the empty space contains counters, these are captured. If the next space after the one in which the capture was made is also empty, followed by a space with counters, these are also captured, continuing with any unbroken sequence of empty and occupied spaces.

When one player has no counters in their spaces, they place five of their captured counters, one in each of their spaces, and continue to play.

Play ends when both of the large spaces are empty. The players evenly split any remaining counters on the board.

A new round begins. Players fill their spaces with their captured stones. The player with fewer counters must then ""sell"" spaces on their side to the opponent to have enough counters to fill the holes. If the difference in the number of captured counters is less than ten, the opponent is given half-ownership of a space, and the contents of it at the end of the game are split between the two players. If the difference is ten, the opponent then may take all of the stones from a sold space at the end of the game. The player may regain sold spaces on subsequent rounds by capturing ten counters more than their opponent. The game is then played as before. Games are played until three or four squares in the same row have been sold. The winner is the player who has captured the three or four spaces.

			Definitions:

			A group is an entire set of connected stones of the same color. A single stone, not connected to others of its color, is also a group.
			A group is dead if there is no path of connected empty cells between that group and any other of its color.

			Play:

			On your turn, perform the following actions in the stated order:

			1. Place a stone of your color on an empty cell. If it is your first turn of the game, perform this action twice.
			2. Remove all dead enemy groups.
			3. Remove all dead friendly groups.

			The board positions at the start and at the end of your turn must be different.

			The last player to make a placement wins. Note that, after your first turn, you will always have a placement available unless you have no groups on the board.
			
			To make the game fair, White will have the option, on their first turn only, to swap sides with Black instead of making a regular move.

			Note that, in this implementation, the two stones you place on your first turn are only visible after both cells to place on have been selected.

            Alternative balancing methods:

			The balancing method described above is what is called 'strong pie' in the options. 
			This implementation also offers two other methods, for players who would like to explore alternatives.

			Weak pie: Just like with strong pie, White will have the option, on their first turn only, to swap sides with Black instead of making a regular move.
			But instead of placing twice on their first move, players alternate placing one piece each (with no removals) until 4 setup stones are placed.
			Consequently, White's choice will be made after Black has placed only one stone.
			            
			Komi pie: The first player chooses a whole number of komi (between 1 and 12) and the second player chooses whether to play as White (pass) or as Black (place a stone).
			The first 4 stones are placed in the same order as with weak pie (Black, White, Black, White).
			Throughout the game proper, White will have the option to spend a point of komi instead of making a placement.

The last player to complete a turn wins - typically when the opponent runs out of pieces in their hand.

Each player starts with a full set of 9 pieces: each combination of shape and color. Pieces once played are not owned, but may be recaptured during the game for reuse.

The game starts with a placement by the first player.
Thereafter, each turn has a placement followed by a movement, and one or more required piece recaptures if available.

-- 1. Placement:
The first step in every turn is a placement to an empty point next to at least one existing piece that can slide.

-- 2. Movement:
The player must choose on piece next to the newly placed piece and slide it orthogonally one or two points to a new position. The piece can only move to empty points, never crossing a piece in play.

-- 3. Capture:
Either (or both) of the first two actions can form one or more 'mills'.

A mill is an orthogonal line of three uniquely different piece types that all share one common attribute - either color or shape.

The player completes their turn by destroying every mill on the board by removing one of the 2 unmoved pieces that it contains. (Newly added and moved pieces may not be removed.)

Play Overview: 
    The board starts empty. 
  
    Turns consist of placement or movement, followed by consequential removals. Placement has priority over movement. 
    The destinations for both placement and movement are restricted. Movement has an additional limitation.
    
    The game ends when a player cannot take a turn, or when, at the end of a turn, a distinctly connected group of 4 of either player's pieces forms double-run of values (1123, 1223, 1233) in any order.
    
    Turns:
    --- if possible: ---
    A) a player must place a piece from his supply onto an empty location,
    -- but never onto a location that is simultaneously adjacent to pieces of every value (1, 2 and 3) without respect to ownership.
    
     --- Otherwise:---
    B) if the previous player has played in a way that prevents placement, then instead, a piece must be moved to an adjacent empty location that meets the same destination restriction as for placement. 
    
    However, a player may not be deprived of placement moves for more turns in a row than he has pieces in play at the start of his turn. If the number of his pieces at the start of his turn is equal to or less than the number of movement turns that he has already taken since his last placement, then he has been stalemated and the game ends in his favor.
    
    He would also be stalemated if there were no legal step moves available on the board.
    
    Removals:
    After the placement or movement, simultaneously remove every piece on the board that is adjacent to pieces of all 3 values without respect to ownership of the pieces and of their neighbors.
    These removed pieces are 'consumed'; they are not returned to the players' supply.
    
    Scoring:
          
    A player who stalemates the opponent loses: the player who is unable to move scores one point for each piece of his color in play.

A 'chain' is any set of player's stones that comprised of a starting stone and every stone which can be reached from it by a series steps between adjacent stones.

Starting with an empty board, players alternate taking turns.

A turn consists of either placing or moving a stone followed by removing opposing stones, if applicable.

Placing:
A friendly stone may be placed either:
- 1) where there are no adjacent stones of either player, or
- 2) where the number of stones in adjacent chains that belong to the opponent equal those that belong to the player including the stone to be placed.

For example: A stone may be placed next to an opponent's 1-chain (isolated stone).

Moving:
B) A friendly stone may be moved one step to an empty site, but only if the number of chains on the board is reduced by merger and the merged chain becomes at least as large as every opponent's chain that it is adjacent to.

Special movement restrictions:
Pieces may not step to merge with a chain that is the larger than any other chain on the board. This restriction does not affect the placement rule. It also does not apply if more than one group is tied for largest.

Removing stones:
After placement or movement, the player removes every opponent's stone that is directly adjacent to a larger friendly chain than its own.

When the turn is completed, only chains of equal size remain in contact.

Ending the game:
There is no passing. The game ends when either player is unable to move.

Players begin with soldiers, equal in number to the number of spaces in one row for each player, which begin in the spaces in the row closes to the player. Each player has one king piece, which begins in the rightmost space in the central row with respect to the player. Four six-sided dice with values from 1-6. A throw of 1 is called Chong. Pieces move in a boustrophedon path along the board, from left to right in their home row, right to left in the center row, and then left to right in their opponent's row. 

A player must first throw a Chong to play. On this turn, when a player throws one Chong, the King exchanges places with the soldier behind it. If more than one Chong is thrown, the King exchanges places with the soldier that many spaces behind it. Any remaining values in the throw are moved by the soldier which took the king's space. Once this move has taken place, pieces move according to the throws of the dice, which can be subdivided between the pieces as the player sees fit. The King only moves with a Chong, and it exchanges the place of a piece that number of occupied squares away, i.e., only spaces occupied by the player's pieces are counted when moving the King. When the player has only one soldier and the King, the King may move normally (like a soldier does), but on throws of Chong. When only the King is left, the first Chong in a throw is ignored and only the second, third, or fourth Chongs are moved.  

When a player's piece lands on a space occupied by an opponent's piece, the opponent's piece is captured. An opponent's King cannot be taken by a soldier until it has first moved backwards, and then it can only be taken by a Chong.

The dark squares make up the house of the Dark player, and the light squares make up the house of the Light player. The goal is to empty your opponent's house.

There are two types of moves in Overflow, both of which are sowing moves, somewhat akin to what you see in mancalas. All moves are bound by the restriction that there must always be exactly one orthodiagonally connected group of stacks on the board. The one kind of sowing only drops pieces onto already occupied squares and the other kind spills out of both the group of already occupied squares and out of the board itself, hence the names: contained moves and overflow moves.

Sowing in general:
Sowing in general is picking up a stack from any square and distributing its pieces along one of the 8 directions onto a contiguous line of squares – usually placing one of the N pieces from the chosen stack in each of the N or so squares in the sowing direction. The details are given below.

Overflow moves:
An overflow move involves sowing into empty squares – possibly in addition to occupied squares – and over the edge of the board. It's important to remember that these two things always go together in this game, namely (1) sowing over the edge and (2) sowing into empty squares. That is to say, if you are to sow into one or more empty squares, the number of squares in the chosen sowing direction must be smaller than the number of stones in the chosen stack. The pieces that end up outside the board are removed from the game.

Contained moves:
Contained moves only sow onto already occupied squares. A contained move must sow the chosen stack as far as possible. If it's impossible to sow each of the pieces in the stack into an occupied square of its own, you place the remainder of the pieces on the last occupied square you reached. You are not obligated to chose the stack that can be sown the farthest, but whatever stack you chose, if you do not make an overflow move move with it, you must chose a sowing direction that allows you to sow onto as many occupied squares as possible.

You may always chose freely between contained moves and overflow moves when both kinds are available.

Note that no stack will have both a contained move and an overflow move available in the same direction. All moves are completely determined by the choice of stack and direction.",,,,,,,"0,5520",0,,0,0

GROUPS AND LIBERTIES: 
A group is an orthogonally interconnected collection of one or more like-colored stones. 
Only black groups and white groups will be discussed here, not red groups. 
A liberty is an unoccupied point adjacent to a (black or white) group

CAPTURES:
A capturing placement results in one or more groups, of either or both colors, having no liberties. 
Such a placement can only be made with a red stone. 
Conversely, a red stone can only be placed if it bounds (completely deprives of liberties) one or more groups of either or both colors. Red stones are permanent. They cannot themselves be captured.
Self capture is allowed.

When multiple groups without liberties result from a placement, all such groups are removed immediately following said placement, regardless of the groups' colors.

1831,1994,1597,Default,,,1,,"Polypods is a game about groups of connected stones called Polypods.
    
    Understanding the mythical life of a polypod should help you to easily remember the rules.
    
    Polypods are creatures that have poisonous body segments that tie together its numerous feet. To survive, at least half of a polypod must be its feet, and this determines how they may grow and the shapes they may take. 
    
    The feet die and fall off upon contact with the poisonous body segments of other polypods,  however, since the feet themselves are not poisonous, there is no harm in their contact with other polypod's feet. Fortunately a polypod's foot is able to smell the area around it, and thus a polypod avoids extending its feet to touch the bodies of competing polypods.
    
    Hungry polypods do, however, find ways to bring their body against a foot of another polypod, causing that foot (or feet) to self-amputate.     If the attacking polypod is lucky, the loss of a foot will cause its neighbor to die. 
    
    The attacking polypod then ingests the body of its dead neighbor and spawns new polypods in the dead neighbor's feet.
    
    Definitions:
-- A POLYPOD is a group of interconnected stones. The group includes every stone of the same color that is connected to it.
(A single stone, or monopod, is also considered as a polypod in these rules.)

Each stone in a polypod has one of two roles: Body or foot.   
-- FOOT STONES (FEET) are stones that connect to at most two other friendly stones:- and if connected to two stones, those two must already be adjacent to each other. 
-- BODY STONES are those that serve to link all the polypod feet together. 

As the polypods grow or shrink, the roles of their individual stones change accordingly.
(In this application the body stones are marked with squares for convenience in reading the board.)

A polypod is ALIVE if it has at least as many feet as body stones.

-- Foot stones in contact with a body stone of the opposite color SELF-AMPUTATE (ie get immediately removed from the board)
-- when a Polypod DIES, its body stones are removed, and its feet change ownership.

Rules:
The game uses discs played on the intersections of a triangular grid of the desired size and shape. 
The board starts empty and Dark starts. Turns Alternate.

The moving player, either passes, or does the following sequence of actions, if possible:
1. The mover places a piece on an empty space.
-- The placement must not cause the immediate self-amputation of the placed stone.
-- It may add to or merge friendy polypods, UNLESS this would cause those polypod(s) to die.
2. The mover removes all self-amputating feet.
3. The mover resolves all polypod deaths.

The game ends when the players pass consecutively.

The winner is determined by tallying the value of each player's polypods.
The value of a polypod is the number of body stones that it contains.
If tied, score all the empty spaces adjacent to the players' own polypods.

     If you can move you have to do so, even if it is a bad move.
    If you stalemate yourself, the other player can move until you can move again.
    
    STARTER-generation: If you reach the same color of one of your own pieces in the opposite ring, you get a new starter to your base (center of the rings) from your reserve. This also works from the base with a start-move (base to own ring).

    To CAPTURE an enemy, you need to be able to reach the same color of the enemy-piece in the opposite ring, then the possibility to directly capture the enemy on its board-position will be available.
    Capturing is not mandatory, you can also just go to the opposite-color position (move 'into the shadow'). Capturing with a start-move from the base is not possible.
     RingCapture: with steplenght 8 you could theoretically move in a circle to your own position, but as normal move this is not allowed.
    But if there is an enemy-piece on the opposite same color, the (ring-)capture-move ist allowed! For steplengths of 12 or 14 etc this is also possible from some other positions.

    The captured pieces remain under the attacker in a stack and have to be brought to the Transmitter (field in the middle of the board) with the according steplength.
    If you reach the transmitter, your pieces in the stack go back to base as starters, and the enemies land in your prison.
     First player to make 3 prisoners wins.

    Only pieces with a captured enemy can land on the Transmitter for prisonertransport. (Exception: #LastMan)
    Single pieces just step over it. With high steplength you can move in circles or to the other side and back, but not turn 180 degrees.
    
    Special Rules to balance the Start:
     From the Start-situation (or later, when there are temporarily no picese on colored positions) you cannot copy the move of the enemy, ie move to the same color with your first piece.

    #CounterAttack: If your first starter is attacked immediately (by the first enemy move), you are allowed to start also to the colors in the enemy-ring with your second starter. In this case, there is no Starter generation, if you move to the opposite color of your first piece (to protect it from capturing).

     Special Rules for Endgame:
    #LastMan: If you are left with just a single piece on the colored board positions (and no starter on your base), you may enter the Transmitter to move the piece to your base and get a second starter (if you still have one in your reserve)!

    #PrisonerExchange: Move a prisoner to your (empty) homebase, and you get an additional Starter taken from your reserve & the prisoner goes back to his reserve. You have to move this new starter immediately: the PrisonerExchange itself counts not as a full move.
