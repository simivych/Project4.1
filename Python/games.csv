0,3,Senet,,"Senet is one of the oldest board games known in the world, documented from about 3000 BCE until the first millennium BCE in Egypt.

Game boards that the form of 36 symbols, placed in three rows of twelve but divided in the middle by either a gap or other, larger signs, such as circles or rosettes. Sometimes the 36 symbols are letters, forming six six-letter words that form a poem or phrase, often relating to game play. One board, from Ostia, may indicate that game play started in the left hand side of the center row of signs, progressed to the right, went from right to left in the top row, and then left to right in the bottom row.

4,7,20 Squares,,"20 Squares appears for the first time at the beginning of the second millennium BCE.

Two cuneiform tablets which attest to the rules of the game as played in Seleucid times have recently been translated. There has been some discussion over the ancient name of the game. The best argument is made by Wee (2018: 870) who identified the name as É Er-bé-et-ta, ""Room Four,"" which he also finds in other cuneiform tablets. Others have pointed to a Middle Kingdom Egyptian tomb painting at Beni Hasan which may show two men playing the game, accompanied by the caption ""iseb"" or ""aseb"" (Crist et al 2016: 85–87). Earlier scholars assumed that a game named ""Tjau"" mentioned in some Late Period Egyptian texts was this game (e.g., Peterson 1974: 853), but that has been rejected by more recent scholars (Pusch 2007: 84).",530,35.0,,Mesopotamia,1,1,"É Er-bé-et-ta, Iseb, Aseb, Game of Twenty, Twenty Squares, Room Four",,,0,Eric Piette,50,23211.0,"28°40'30.41""N, 57°44'13.74""E","1200,3499",0,,0,0,0,0

Hamilton sold this game to a London game dealer in 1859 for 25 pounds, and the game was subsequently marketed in Europe in a number of forms (Gardner 1957). The game marketed two versions of it, under the name Around the World. One version, for the parlor, was played on a flat board; another, for the traveler, consisted of an actual dodecahedron. In both cases, nails at each vertex stood for a major city of the world and the player wrapped a piece of string around these nails as they went. In the event, the game was a complete sales flop, mainly because it was too easy, even for children – but not for Hamilton himself who always used the icosian calculus to figure out his moves, instead of just trying different paths like everyone else!",615,615.0,"<a href=""https://mathworld.wolfram.com/IcosianGame.html"" target=""_blank"" class=""style1"" style=""color: #0000EE"" />mathworld</a> and <a href=""https://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/I/Icosian_Game.html"" target=""_blank"" class=""style1"" style=""color: #0000EE"" />daviddarling</a>",,0,1,Hamiltonian game,Sir William Rowan Hamilton,,0,Tahmina Begum,,,,"0,5520",0,,0,0,0,0

Stones enter unconnected, and can only move by fleeing from concentrations of enemy stones. Thus it is a movement game with a territorial aspect.  
    
The game includes capture-by-hopping moves, which create mutual-enemy stones as an intermediate stage before possible reconversion back to player's stones. This mechanism keeps the game provably finite. 
    
The pseudo-territories formed by the clumps of stones, have boundaries that can erode and shift; so the game is more tactical than strategic. Shifts in strategic concerns do occur, however, as the game evolves from first mainly claiming territory by placement density, to a race to agglomerate or capture, to fights to recapture vs blocking to retain lead in a tactical end game. 
    
Because the effect of the mutual-enemy stones on movement is symmetrical but not the same for the two players, the game requires considerable mental concentration.",1153,1153.0,"<a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2557883"" target=""_blank"" class=""style1"" style=""color: #0000EE"" />BGG</a>",,0,1,,Dale W.

891,997,Hops-a-Daisy Generalized,,"Equi-based games are games played on a hex grid that share the following properties:
Each player has two kinds of pieces, one kind (Discs) move using steps and/or hops with flip-captures, the other kind (Hexes) are stationary. The stationary pieces have more score value, and they are limited to certain sites of placement. Identifying the placement sites for the stationary Hex pieces is based on their having an equal number of influencing neighbor pieces belonging to the player and to his (selected) enemy.

Turns consist of either: placing any a piece, or moving a Disc. The Disc move may be followed by optionally placing a Hex piece. The game ends when in succession, none of the players adds a piece to the board. The winner is the player who has the highest score, with the first player not to place a piece winning in the case of a tiebreaker. 

In the original game of Equi, The influencing neighbor pieces were found along lines of sight, and included only those pieces that were at the same distance as the nearest of them. The original game also had special placement limitations not discussed here, to reduce cycling. These evolved into produce the version cited here.

Areas of variation. The main families are: 
1. Equi - Line of sight based rules, forced flip-hopping of enemy pieces, and optional friendly hops, piece values same magnitude, but opposite sign. Details are that moving Disc pieces can only be entered onto non-Equi sites and not to suicide sites. The game is intended as a 2 player strategy game.

Equiversi - intended to be easier to play and more territorial and have less cycling issues.
The first change was to replace line of sight influence with adjacent piece influence, that is easier to see. With the increase in hex placement opportunities thus available, friendly hops were disallowed.

Then a second evolution, Equiversi-2, occurred with the concept of allowing players to decide a range of piece values for the Discs prior to play, -- represented here only by the selection of a zero value. Reduced value allowed for a relaxation of all placement restrictions on the Discs. An implementation side effect is that selecting a site gives a piece-choice pop-up for those sites where Hexes may be played. Pre-selecting the piece to play would be a better implementation.

Evolution to Hops-a-Daisy            
Nothing in the game prohibits a multi-player implementation, except that king-making could be an issue. Thus the idea of a small, light multi-player game based on Equi was born. To increase the chaotic experience, the hop changes both piece type and ownership leading to entirely different strategies. 

Hops-a-Daisy default rules allow hopping any piece, 'morphing' it (changing its type). Opponent's pieces are flipped to the mover's ownership as well. For ease of play, Disc placement is either to Non-Hex sites or unlimited. Hex placement considers all opponents as enemies. These settings can be changed to restrict hopping and/or Hex placement rules to either the preceding or following player's pieces. The game is strictly for fun and thus should be played on a small board.

These games also inspired Refugia, with different placement restrictions, single piece types, and ownership changes taking place in stages, which has been implemented separately on Ludii.",1159,1159.0,,,0,1,,Dale W. Walton,,0,Dale W. Walton,,,,"0,5520",0,,0,0,0,0

949,1066,Throngs,,"Throngs a highly abstracted wargame (territorial invasion game) for two players. It is typically played on the intersections of a triangular grid, using Go stones. It is a double-move game: each player takes 2 full turns in succession before the next player takes control. 
            
            Movement: The game is distinguished by the way the power of a moving piece is determined according to the pieces around it: A piece can move as far as the difference in count of the friends and enemies in its immediate vicinity. 
            
            Removing an enemy and adding one's own piece take one power unit each. Remaining power goes into a series of steps or hops that may change direction at empty locations. 
            
            Strategy: Power to travel up to seven units per move can be developed during the game. As the offensive capacity develops, defensive measures are needed, first starting with limiting the mobility of enemy stones by approaching them, then by building walls, and thickening them along the axes of the opponent's catapulting sites (empty locations surrounded by many of that player's own stones.) These sites allow adding a stone and catapulting it up to a distance of 5, and are re-useable. In addition to these methods, defense is by scattering stones behind one's own lines to immobilise enemy stones that invade.
            
            The majority of turns naturally involve placement as well as movement, due to the benefit of gaining material; even though newly placed stones travel a reduced distance due to the cost of their placement. Occasional moves without placement are used mainly to initiate difficult invasions, as they risk simultaneously opening up positional weaknesses.  
            
            Individual stones may be captured by replacement when they are sufficiently out-numbered at a location, which means that towards the end of the game, chains of stones not anchored to a triangle, loop, or board edge will be consumed one-by-one by captures. Thus the shape and nature of territorial walls is worth contesting.
            
            Boards: The standard board is centerless, designed to allow maximal distance moves from the center, while minimizing the size of the board. The hexagonal corner regions help to stabilize invasions in outlying areas. The reverse angles along the edge are slightly less defensible than the other parts, breaking the edges into stategic zones.
            
            The game is easily adapted not only to to different size and shape boards, but also to different grid topologies, while remaining interesting and playable. A 'perforated' grid is included to demonstrate this, but there are many other possibilities as well. 
            
            The center of the board is very advantageous, and a pie rule or balanced starting positions are needed. The standard starting position places the initial pieces near the edges to allow players a wider variety of strategies. Placing multiple starting stones, and or playing on torus boards, leads to finer grained, denser, highly tactical games, while using few starting pieces and larger boards or boards with less connectivity (e.g. boards with holes, and boards on semi-regular grids) lead to a more territorial game.
            
        Play on a torus also eliminates the advantage of a board center, but requires a larger board because invasion is no longer from a single direction.",1224,1224.0,"<a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2452882/throngs-new-attempt-describe-how-play"" target=""_blank"" class=""style1"" style=""color: #0000EE"" />BGG Forum</a>",,0,1,,Dale W.

This game was the winner of the second Annual Game Design Competition in 2002, whose theme that year was the design of games of unequal forces (organized by Abstract Games magazine, About Board Games, and the Strategy Gaming Society). The name came from a symmetric ancestor game called 'Lur'. When the game was supported on Ludoteka, the Edge rule was added because placing on the edge is usually bad for Black. More information about the origins of the game can be found in Spanish on the designer's blog:

1039,1167,Goats Wintering,,"'Goats Wintering' gives the impression of goats gathering into herds in a sheltered area as winter approaches. 
The goal is to maximize the connections between the goats. However, goats may not be placed too close to others of their kind along sight-lines. So there is tension in who can place and move their goats together most efficiently.

The novel movement mechanism is that a goat's movement is restricted to steps that increase its friendly contact, -- or, when increasing friendly contact is not avaiable to it, steps that decrease its contact with competing goats.

When goats get close enough to others of their kind, they can then thus move to join a flock and increase the connections. But frequently they will need the presence of the opponent's goats to be able to get this close to their own flocks. This is because goats allow movement choices for any goats near them: isolated goats can't move. So, the tension is in finding places to enter one's goats that are at a suitable range to gather them together.

There is capture: Moves that fully surround any of the opponents goats cause those goats to leave the play area. 
To prevent cycling, the subordinate kind of goat move is not allowed after a pass. This allows a player with a strong lead to pass until the other player runs out of moves and the game ends.

        
The game is inspired from Infuse by the same Author, but the clumping here is more open and pronounced and clumps are distance-limited, not line-of-sight limited. 

It may be played on either hex grids with adjacent movement, or square grids with ortho-diagonal diagonal movement.",1327,1327.0,,,0,1,,Dale W. Walton,,0,Dale W. Walton,,,,"0,5520",0,,0,0,0,0

1235,1376,Brain Coral,,"Brain Coral is a placement game based on the principle of placing pieces, such that afterwards, every site of the board remains connected to an empty site at the perimeter via a series of empty sites. 
            
    Scoring is based on the size of the largest group plus a bonus factor. 
       
    The standard bonus factor is the number of your own groups.
       
    Thus enlarging your largest group has the same value as creating a cloud of singletons, and anything else -- other than forcing your opponent to add to or join together non-largest groups, -- is a wasted opportunity. 
         
    Basic strategy is either
    -- A: to form a defensive cloud to break opponent's efforts into multiple regions, and then, to connect your remaining dots into a single series; or else
    -- B: to create a large group for as long as you can, then cloud the other areas in self-blocking ways. 
        
    The other bonus options are simpler, and thus need larger boards to be interesting:
    
    Bonus for number of opponent's groups, makes play highly cohesive -- you need to form one big group, -- but with an emphasis on controlling empty teritory, because the opponent is penalised when forced to place isolated pieces at the end.
         
    Playing without any bonus play is similar, but decided earlier, as territory is not an issue, only main group size.
    
    Tiebreakers:
    The standard tiebreaker is for the underdog to win based on the largest cascading group size without bonus. 
    If all groups are paired in size with the opponent, last to play wins. 
    For informal play, the tie breaker simplified as last-to-place.",1548,1548.0,,,0,1,,Dale W. Walton,,0,Dale W. Walton,,,,"0,5520",0,,0,0,0,0
1236,1377,Windflowers,,"Windflowers is a finite, 2-4 player, place-or-capture, connectivity game. 
            It is playable on a wide variety of grid and connectivity types.
            
            It is still experimental, as the best scoring and tiebreker combination needs to be resolved.
            Also more investigation is needed concerning the degree that kingmaking will be a broblem for the multiplayer version.
            
            Placement is to empty sites: Capture is by replacing an opponent's stone during placement if that opponent owns more of the surrounding stones than the moving player does. On boards with diagonals, diagonal connections are included in the count to determine if a piece can be captured, but are not used for determining scoring groups discussed below.
            
            Passing is allowed, and the game ends when all players have passed consecutively. The board typically is full at this point, but there might be capture options still available that are disadvantageous to take.
            
            Scoring has 2 options: 
            Either scoring for stones placed, or for the largest group.
            Tie breakers scoring is needed to reduce the frequency of ties.
            
            multi-player cascade group scoring: Between those tied for winner, each pair of players is considered separately and the difference in size of their largest groups (after excluding all pairs of equal-size groups) is awarded to the owner of the larger group for cascade scoring (or to the owner of the smaller group for underdog scoring.)  Underdog tiebreaking is currently prefered.
            In 2-player games, the last player to place is the final tie-breaker.
            
            Finiteness:
            Each individual placement/capture is obviously finite as eventually one of the players with the smallest number of surrounding pieces will have placed there. Proof is needed that, as a whole, cycling is impossible, but this is what is experienced practically, even with multiple players.
            
            If every thing is equal, the last to play wins. Thus on even boards, the first player is obligated to break mirror play to win.

  The game solves the cross-cut problem of boards with cells that meet 4-to-a-vertex in some locations, by use of a capture based on a majority n of adjacencies, thus preventing immediate recapture. To minimise the amount of captures, and thus provide the a more strategic game than one based on simple majority captures, the captures are limited to those that resolve crosscuts along an existing diagonal connection, using a lobsided 'V' pattern of surrounding stones. -- and restricting edge capture to captures adjacent to an adjacent pair of stones. 
  
  Option is provided for independently relaxing these restrictions.
  A pie offer option has not yet been implemented.  
  
  The boards provided are a 48 cell and 160 cell board, designed specifically to provide an odd number of neighbors to each cell: 5 in the interior, and 3 at every edge cell. The Cairo board is one of the few regualr grids that permit such a condition. It also dilutes the possible cross-cuts to two per location, compared with 4 per location on a square grid.",1585,1585.0,"<a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2693572"" target=""_blank"" class=""style1"" style=""color: #0000EE"" />BGG</a>",,0,1,,Dale W.

1289,1434,Sprout-R-Out,,"Sprout-R-Out is a newly invented territorial game for Cairo and limping Hex boards based on an original placement protocol: 
            Players place one stone next to each opponent's group, but without touching any other group. Any group that cannot be played beside is removed.
            
            This creates an capture dynamic superficially like Go where groups get overgrown and die.  Unlike Go, a single, isolated eye, once formed, is enough to give life.
            
            On the other hand, even multiple larger eyes can be insufficient for life, because the timing of capture and the requirement to play against every opponent's group if possible, can leave multiple eyes filled with uncaptured stones.
            
            The feeling of the game definitely not like Go. The game is more tactical because placements are constrained to be adjacent to existing pieces, and multiple pieces are played per turn. 
            
            Spreading pieces out to quickly surround the opponent during your turn can easily backfire, as it leads to more opponent placements and fewer locations needed by the opponent to surround your pieces.",1649,1649.0,"Dale W.

1300,1447,Branching Coral,,"Branching Coral is a placement game based on the principle of placing pieces, such that, after placement, every site on the boards still has a connection via empty sites to an empty site at the perimeter. 
            
    Branching Coral differs from its parent game Brain Coral by having a capture mechanism: After placement, all the neighboring stones with less than 2 adjacent empty sites are simultaneously captured. The placed piece itself must have 2 adjacent empty spaces before the captures to be a legal placement.
         
    These capture conditions assure that the game is finite, and that the ending patterns that form are varied and gracefully branched, without thick regions either of pieces or empty space.
                        
    Scoring is based on the size of the largest group plus a bonus factor. 
    The standard bonus factor is number of opponent's pieces captured.  This works to reward capture and thus encourages breaking up opponent's groups, while remaining straight forward in the need to enlarge your largest group, it allows creating come-back groups, or staging combacks by capturing material.
          
    Other bonus options are:
    Bonus for number of your own groups, serving to encourage you to make one large group and many singletons, to break up your opponent's largest group, and to try to force the opponent to connect small groups into medium sized groups. This is similar to Brain Coral, with the added tactical element of capture.
         
    Bonus for number of opponent's groups; which is less interesting because it encourages players to form large clumps and to break up and limit opponent's group growth, and potentially partial mimicry in play. 
         
    Playing without any bonus, is similar to opponent group count bonus, but even more straight forward. It leads to clumping, though there still is a need for defense from captures severing connections. In this version the game will normally be decided early because neither player can extend or break the critical group, and there is not enough space to create a larger one. Thus this option needs the largest boards.
         
    The standard tiebreaker is for the underdog to win based on the largest cascading group size without bonus. 
    If all groups are paired in size with the opponent, last to play wins.

1306,1453,N-Mesh,,"N-Mesh is a game on a square grid that evolved from Netted, an enclosure game on a hex grid. 
   
   The game is a race to deprive the opponent of liberties by surrounding the opponent's stones and or by destroying the liberties by placing stones on them. 
   
   If the players surround each other, the player with fewer captured stones wins, and where the result is still undetermined, the last to play loses. This latter rule prevents players from simply racing to cover up the liberties.  

-------------
   The main differences from Netted is that life in N-Mesh requires only a single liberty for a region, and the liberties are specific cells distributed across the board. (Netted liberties were the edge cells and each stone required its own exclusive liberty)
 
   The difference in geometry also causes differences in connectivity: 
   Both feature 3 types of connectivity used strategically to separate the opponent's stones from liberties. 
   These include adjacency, as well as a short type of connection that can permanently cross the other player's connections and a longer type of connection that can be broken. 
   In N-Mesh the long connections are at knight's move distance, and are broken by a pair of stones placed in between, and the crossing connections are diagonals.

-------------   
   Surrounding is done by nets. A net is made of adjacent stones as well as stones connected by diagonals and single empty spaces. Thus opponent's nets can cross each other and a portion of a net may be surrounded without surrounding the whole net. Having a connection to a living stone does not guarantee life to another stone: what provides life to a stone is having an empty liberty cell in the same region defined by the opponent's surrounding net.
         
    Offensive tactics include:
    - Threatening to capture over-extended pieces, 
    -- especially to pick off a single stone in diagonal-plus-double-knight's-move triangle,
    -- covering liberties in uncontrolled areas to capture a larger group or to make group life harder to achieve,
    -- or by creating forks.
    
    - Using knight's moves to quickly fence off large territory. 
    -- enclosing more liberties and spaces to place on so that ones groups can survive longest
    - Reinforcing threatened knight's connections by adding a stone there.
    
    Defensive tactics include: Blocking threats by 
    - breaking a knight's move connection by extending a line of stones across it. 
    - placing on the site the opponent needs to complete the threat,
    - encircling the threat location, or for edges sites, 
    - reducing the cut-off region to one empty edge site.
    
    Notes: 
    -- Spacing of the liberties is arbitrary, but has been standardized to a regular spacing that can work on small and large boards, in order to allow the transfer of tactical knowledge from size to size.
    -- The distribution is purposefully asymmetrical to allow the greatest variety of pie offerings. 
    -- If the game is to be played without a pie rule, a symmetrical arrangement is preferred for greater balance.
    The pie rule means that the game is a proven 2nd-player win, and the quality of the AI can be judged accordingly.",1666,1666.0,,,0,1,,Dale W. Walton,,0,Dale W. Walton,,,,"0,5520",0,,0,0,0,0

1314,1461,Astralesce and Constellation,,"'Astralesce' and 'Constellate' are games based loosely on Kanare Kato's 'Advanced Squish'.
    
    The mechanism found in 'advanced Squish' of: 'move toward in-line-targets that are part of larger groups', is extended in these games to a future look-ahead restriction, i.e.:
    'move along a line from a starting location to a location that is in line with a larger group than the moving piece had been in line with before.'
    
    This is inherently difficult perceptually, and it remains to be seen if the game can be played without the assistance of an app.
    
    However the game is both interesting and exciting, and appears to have various levels of strategy.     
      
    The goal is unification, and causing a stalemate before achieving the goal is considered a loss.
    
    'Astralesce' has sliding moves and captures that can remove multiple pieces. Thus stalemate is impossible, as the opponent cannot block movement. This is the preferred game.
    
    'Constellation' also has sliding moves, but only allows capture at the move's desination. This means opponent's pieces can block some potential destinations.",1731,1731.0,,,0,1,,Dale W. Walton,,0,Dale W. Walton,,,,"0,5520",0,,0,0,0,0
1315,1462,Conflagration and Keep-a-riding,,"Two of several Games inspired by Kanare Kato's 'Squish'
            
            Originally 'Squish' was a unification game with step movement toward a friendly piece in-line, possibly involving a capture.  'Advanced Squish' added a requirement on non-capturing steps for the piece to become part of a larger group. (Singletons were exempted.)
            
            -- 'Keep-a-Riding' and 'Conflagration' differ from 'Squish' by being explicitly stalemate games: Last to move wins or loses, respectively.  
            They also differ by using slide captures, and by not including the 'Squish' core principle that requires movement toward in-line friendly pieces. 
            Instead, they require the step move to bring the moving piece into new contact with another friendly piece.            
            They typically end with only a few pieces on the board, and one player may be entirely eliminated.
            
            'Keep-a-Riding' is themed as a 'last man standing' team demolition derby. But, knocking out an opponent's piece can only be done with pieces that cannot step to become part of a larger group.
            
            'Conflagration', is themed 'fighting fire with fire': Getting eliminated is a win. Containment, where none of your flame pieces can move, is also a win.
            
        Conflagration has 2 subvariants 'Firestorm' and 'BackFire' in which the choice of moves that each flame piece can take are prioritized.
        - BackFire is shorter, more aggressive, because a flame piece must capture (become a 'backfire') if it can. 
        - Firestorm requires a flame piece to step to join its own kind if it can, leading to a slower elimination of the flames in the end game.",1732,1732.0,,,0,1,,Dale W. Walton,,0,Dale W. Walton,,,,"0,5520",0,,0,0,0,0

1317,1464,Double-Move Situ,,"Double-move Situ is based on 'Situ' a finite, Line-of-Sight game with the goal of being the last player able to complete their turn. The game is based on the choice of placing one's own piece or removing an opponent's piece.

It can be played on hex grids, square grids or square grids with diagonals.
The original Situ was played on a Hex grid with N, N+1 edges and a single stone pie-rule as an option.

In contrast, 'Double-move Situ' starts with a single placement followed by double moves thereafter. Therefore centerless boards with an even number of nodes are used, and a Hex with edges N, N+2 assures this. 

However there is a changing parameter that determines which sites are controlled, and this parameter affects balance. So, the first player has the option of removing upto 2 nodes from the board, before the 2nd player starts with the single piece placement.

Placement must be on empty nodes that are not controlled by the opponent, while removals are taken from nodes that the mover controls.

Control is determined by the difference in count between the two player's pieces in line-of-sight of the given node. This difference is the  parameter for the game.  When the its value is met or exceeded, the player with the excess LoS pieces controls the site.

In the original Situ this parameter is fixed at 2. In Double-move Situ it can be set from 1 to 4. The lower the number, the larger number of restricted nodes and possible captures, so the more tactical the game is. With higher numbers the game becomes more strategic. In any case, the game is finite, ending with one player running out of nodes to play upon.

History:
Situ is a descendant of my game Shaka that was designed as an exploration of line-of-sight. Shaka triggered the creation of Michał Zapała's 'Tore' and a flurry of LoS games on BGG Abstract Forum. While Situ may have helped stimulate Michał Zapała's 'Tumbleweed' As Alek Erikson tested Situ with me before assisting Michał with Tumbleweed's development.

Steve Metzger and Luis Bolaños Mures 'Stigmergy' is a similar game, a simplification of 'Tumbleweed', that uses a majority of friendly LoS cells rather than a majority of the players pieces for control, and capture in that game is a flip whereas in 'Situ' it is a simple removal.

A recent BGG thread proposing a game 'InSight' stimulated me to script my original game and create this new version. ",1734,1734.0,,,0,1,,Dale W. Walton,,0,Dale W. Walton,,,,"0,5520",0,,0,0,0,0

1327,1474,Rabbit Warrens,,"This game was designed to meet a challenge of making a territorial game without placement or capture. 
    It also is a loop-forming game, as territory is defined as the area contained within loops - but the goal is not first to make a loop, but rather territory scoring.
    
    The scoring is unique as far as I know. The score is the product of two factors: 
    The first factor is the count of all the empty spaces fully surrounded by the player's pieces (edges don't count as an enclosure)
    The second factor is the number of distinct regions that a player's pieces enclose. A region includes both empty sites and sites occupied by the opponent.
    
    As a player fills a space to sub-divide it, one factor is traded off for the other.
    The board is scaled to be half full with each player having roughly the square of the number of pieces needed to enclose an area equal to the pieces used to enclose it.
    
    Movement is designed to progressively increase density. This moves pieces into contact to form loops, subdived them, and in the extreme, to fill them. 
    Players determine when their score is optimized and pass successively to end the game. 
    
    For flexibility, of movement, pieces can also move to sites of equal friendly density, which makes the game a race with the potential for cooperative cycles. 
    
    To prevent cold positions that would cause forced cycling, there is a secondary restriction for this case: pieces most move to have fewer adjacent enemies. 
    
    This makes filling an opponent's territory difficult, or impossible if one doesn't already have a presence there.
    It also means pieces within or associated with enemy territory have high mobility, and may be used to create or expand territories in the end game (but often at the cost of significantly increasing the other player's score.)

1328,1475,Epoxy,,"Epoxy is a version of 'Shaka' (my ancestor game a few other games including my game Situ.) Shaka was a territorial lines-of-sight game based on out-of-sight entry, sliding moves, increasing stone contact, capture by enclosure and double-pass ending. 

Epoxy does not involve capture, and is a survival game. It is played on a special, 'perforated' triangular grid that makes the game more manageable than pure Shaka by limiting the lines of sight and movement. 

Both Epoxy and Situ improve the balance and opening stability of Shaka by using a '12* double-move protocol' (that is, after the first placement, players alternate taking double turns.)

Epoxy differs from Situ in having no capture, but having movement. Movement is controlled by adjacency to the opponent's stones, effectively locking stones in place as they neighbour more and more opponent's stones. 

This creates territories that can be filled, as well as dead-zones for movement and/or placement. Due to this territorial nature, unlike Situ, turns may be partially passed, but a full pass is by definition a resignation.

Territory equates to the availability of future placements when other movement is no longer possible, and the goal is to be the last to play.",1762,1762.0,,,0,1,,Dale W. Walton,,0,Dale W. Walton,,,,"0,5520",0,,0,0,0,0

The goal is to be the last to complete a turn - this almost always occurs by the opponent running out of pieces.

Each player has their own set in-hand in the beginning, but the pieces are no longer owned once in play. Moves follow a place-then-must-slide-an-adjacent-piece protocol. All turns must be fully completed.

Captures are made by forming mills, and allow a player to restock their hand. A mill is an orthogonal line of 3 uniquely different pieces that share one common attribute. When a player forms a mill, they must remove one of the 2 inactive pieces in that mill back into their own hand for re-use.

To win, the first player must either make one more capture than the opponent, or rarely, prevent the other player from placing a piece by leaving no slide moves available.

1417,1564,Allemande,,"Allemande is a drawless, square board-crossing game that does not allow diagonal connections.
    It evolved from an idea similar to 'Connecticut' by Corey Clark, with comments and suggestions from Luis Bolaños Mures
    based on an unpublished polyomino connection game of his.
    
    The principle is that for a crossing connection game on a square board, where diagonal connections are not counted for the win condition, they must be disallowed to avoid stalemates. - But may be allowed in the case where a true connection between those pieces has been established.

    In such a case, four simultaneous placements are the minimum required to avoid any conceivable stalemate position.
    
    Thus, in this game up to 4 sequential placements are allowed per turn. 
     
    At the end of the turn, no same-color diagonal relationships may remain between pieces that are not otherwise connected orthogonally. 
     
    During the turn, however, diagonal placement is allowed, as long as it is resolved before the turn ends.
     
    The name Allemande comes from the dance, which is stately and in 4 steps. 
     
    Implementation:
    I implemented the 4 placements by using play from a hand of 4. The hand is replenished before a player's turn. This works well as a way to visually keep track of how many pieces have been played. Select moves are used to make each move a single decision, despite the movements. 
     
     Connection is determined by whether the lowest left-edge stone can step a continuous path to the upper rightmost stone.
     
     Issues with implementing this game in Ludii:     
     1. Ludii does not have a turn structure which would allow filtering for illegal diagonals at the end of 4 placements and reversing the entire move. (and that approach would be very inefficient anyway.) 
     
     Therefore each diagonal placement is being resolved on the next placement, and is not allowed as the forth placement.
     And voluntary passing is not allowed when the board is in an illegal state.
      
     This has the side effect that the placement sequence is not entirely arbitrary; but it also reduces AI load.
     
     2. However, when this approach is taken and the placement cannot be resolved, Ludii supplies an automatic pass that does not allow post processing, leaving the board in an illegal condition of having a diagonal placement.
     
     My work-around is to create a reversing move for diagonal placements, but this allows endless cycles.
     
     3. Thus (meta (no Repeat PositionalInTurn)) is needed.
     To allow the reversal, the piece states are not returned to the original values. 
     This solution also prevents endless replay variants, by limiting the choices available.
     It also gives a Human the choice to use 'Undo' in order to explore other placement sequences.
     
     4. A forced pass can happen after the removal, but leaves the board in a legal position.
     
     The AI tends to play out these reversals, and can get caught by the lost opportunities.
     
     Human players will quickly become familiar with what sequence of placements is needed for their purpose, and, if necessary reverse their moves with the undo button until they achieve the desired goal.
     
     In any case, with 4 placements per turn, the AI's are not very good at the game.",1961,1961.0,,,0,1,,Dale W. Walton,,0,Dale W. Walton,,,,"0,5520",0,,0,0,0,0

1419,1566,Double-Run Stone,,"'Double Run Stone' (originally 'A Family of Four') is a two player pattern-forming game that can be played on a variety of grids. 
    The main goal is to create a double run (like in Cribbage) as an isolated group of pieces. For this, you score the value of the included pair. 
    
    Forcing the opponent to stalemate you is intended to be a common secondary goal and win condition.
    
    Play is chaotic due to destination restrictions and required removals that ensure no piece is next to all three values (irrespective of piece ownerships.)
    
    This game is surprising as pattern forming games go, in that it may be played with the same rules on a variety of boards grids or networks. It is tactical and delightfully opaque, and thus best suited to small size boards and informal contests.
    
    The new version eliminates cycles by using a limited piece supply and by limiting the number of serial movements to the number of a player's pieces currently in play. 
        
    The various restrictions combine to create many distinct modes of winning in addition to the pattern forming. They are best served by small tight boards with few enough pieces to make these alternative wins actually occur:
    - Depleting a category of pieces and/or depleting all pieces to prevent one's own placement. 
    - Reducing piece count on the board to minimize the forced movement count needed to win. 
    - Forcing the opponent to fill the board, or eliminate all playable destinations. 
    - Forcing the opponent to remove pieces in a way that creates a group for yourself. 

    These tactics are mostly at odds with setting up your own double-run. For example, completely running out of one type of piece prevents one from forming a double run at all. 
    
    The game is intended to be played in sets and different wins produce different scores so that this is interesting.  Each player's stock of pieces is weighted to make higher scores less likely than lower scores.",1963,1963.0,,,0,1,,Dale W. Walton,,0,Dale W. Walton,,,,"0,5520",0,,0,0,0,0

    Chains of similar size are capable of approaching and attacking each other, when supported by potential mergers from behind. The need for support causes such approaches to be cool. 
    
    Blocking is generally done by chains of disparate size, as they mutually repel the isolated stones needed for the larger chain to attack the smaller. This is what leads to the territorial race by placing outliers into yet open areas for expansion.
    
    The result is a tactical cool clouding of stones, followed by an obstructive race to extend the largest viable group. 
    
    Players must also be careful obstruct their own possibility of (re)connecting chains that have been formed separately, or been cut in an attack.

   The game does not work on a square grid with orthogonal connectivity due to the ability to create large numbers of groups using crosscuts. It works best on grids with high connectivity.
   
   Given the opacity of the opening play, I have chosen to use a relatively small square grid with orthogonal plus diagonal connectivity for groups. It is of an odd order to discourage mirror play.

1443,1591,OffShore,,"Off-shore is a territorial game where territory is based on 3 pillars:
   -- Territory defined by the convex hulls of groups,
   -- Group expansion limited to those groups that are not larger in size than the count of the current number of friendly groups.
   -- The capture of enemy groups by expanding one's territory to encompass them.
   
   A further minor point is that placement into enemy territory is restricted, thus preventing suicide placements, and indeed for standard play, preventing any expansion into the territory at all.
   
   Some of the implications are:
   -- groups can be captured from two sides, no need to surround.
   -- to expand or merge groups, one must first have played enough isolated stones during the game. This rule prevents the game from being a simple race to cut off large corners.
   -- capturing a group therefore also reduces the captured player's expansion potential due to loss of a group, in addition to the reduction in playble space.
   -- merging groups is a powerful key type of move that creates strategic focus, but also reduces future growth potential by reducing the group count.
   -- cells adjacent to stones along the edges of opponent's territory are likely to remain open for play, but care is needed to ensure that, when placing stones there, they are (or can be) connected to regions where the opponent is less able to expand his territory.

1449,1597,Polypods,,"Polypods was created as an exploration of a new capture concept in which a group lives as long as it has more terminal ends than core pieces. Group capture naturally became determinened in two stages: removing terminals, which then in turn cause the group to exceed its core limit. 
    This works best on the hex grid. 
    Since terminals are added in play, they can also be removed without destroying the group.
    All groups fall in the range of with 0 to 3 free terminals. Additions can either help stabilize the group, or destabilize it. 
    Efficiency in scoring encourages growing groups to near the critical size. As does attacking another player's terminals, and being attacked.
    
    Critical size groups are most vulnerable to being killed by terminal attacks instead of merely suffering a terminal loss.
    This is not difficult to use as a tactic, and if the result were to clear too much of the board the game would be too unstable an cycle. Removing only the core, ensures that the resultant groups will be singletons and pairs which are all legal formations, and keep the board from clearing too much. 
    
    However, tit-for-tat captures still can cause major resets. Therefore the capture rule specifies that the ownership of the terminals of the captured groups also changes to the capturing player. 
    
    This final solution allows tactical instability, but strategic stability.
    
    On small boards ties may be more frequent than some players would like. Thus a tie-breaker based on empty territory control has also been added. This value is is intuitive, and not frequently correlated to the core score, so it functions well in this role.
